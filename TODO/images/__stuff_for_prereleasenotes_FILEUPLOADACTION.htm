<p>DISCUSS DOWNLOAD FILES</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Downloading Files from Amazon S3</p>
<p>A common pattern in web applications is to allow a user to download a file 
(for example a .zip file, Excel .xlsx file, .pdf file, etc) to the user's 
machine so that the user can save the file on their computer.</p>
<p>The file that you allow the user to download can either be stored in a binary 
field in a database, or it can be stored as a physical file in a folder on the 
machine that the Alpha Anywhere server can access.</p>
<p>If the file you want to all the user to download is stored on Amazon S3, then 
you have two options when you allow the user to download a file</p>
<p>- You can retrieve the file from Amazon S3 to the Alpha Anywhere server and 
then send the file to the client (just as you would have sent any other file)</p>
<p>- You can allow the client to retrieve the file directly from Amazon S3 (thus 
placing no load on the Alpha server)</p>
<p>Clearly, the second option is much more efficient that the first option. 
However, in the case where the file was upload to Amazon S3 using the 'protected 
read' option, the Alpha Anywhere server must still play a small role. The Alpha 
Anywhere server must generate a 'signed' URL that can be used by the client to 
download the file from Amazon.</p>

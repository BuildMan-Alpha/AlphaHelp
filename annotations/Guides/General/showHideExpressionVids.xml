                <title>Applying Security Client-Side</title>
                <description>
                    <p>A common pattern in applications is to control the visibility (or enabled state) of certain controls on a page based on the 'role' that the user has in the application security framework. For example, a button might only be visible to users in the 'Administration' role.</p>
                    <p>Typically, the security settings are enforced server-side. But in some situations you might want to enforce the security rules on the client-side.</p>
                    <p>In this video we show how controls in a UX can be shown/hidden client-side based on the user's role.</p>

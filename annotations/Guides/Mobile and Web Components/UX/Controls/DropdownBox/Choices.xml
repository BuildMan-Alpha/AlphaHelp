            <title>Populating from the Client-side Data Cache</title>
            <description>
                <p>In mobile applications that are deployed as Cordova applications, or in static HTML applications using the Application Cache, the DropdownBox control is populated with data at the time the application is built.</p>
                <p>In many cases, it will be necessary to update the choices shown in the DropdownBox control with up-to-date data and to continue to use the most recent data available when the App is launched, even when no connection is available. To do this, you can specify the DropdownBox should be populated with data from the Client-side Data Cache.</p>
                <p>In order to indicate that data from the Client-side Data Cache should be used, set the first line of the static choices to the following:</p>
            </description>
            <example code="ui"><![CDATA[client-side-data-cache:itemName(displayDataColumn,storedValueColumn)]]></example>
        </section>

            <description>
                <p> When the App is launched, if a connection is available, the Client-side Data Cache will be refreshed and the DropdownBox will be populated with fresh data. If no connection is available the first time the App is launched the choices you specify in the second and subsequent lines of the defined Static choices will be used.</p>
                <p> For example, assume you had a Client-side Data Cache item called Products and that this item had two columns, Description and Code. In order to populate the DropdownBox to use the Description field as the display value and the Code field as the stored value, you would use this directive in the first line of the Static Choices:</p>
            </description>
            <example code="ui"><![CDATA[client-side-data-cache:Products(Description,Code)]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p>If you want the display value and stored value to be the same, then just specify the name of the display value column for the stored value.</p>
            </description>
            <example code="ui"><![CDATA[client-side-data-cache:itemName(displayColumn,storedValueColumn)]]></example>

                <p>The image below shows how the choices in a DropdownBox control would be defined to read the data from a Client-side Data Cache item called weekdays.</p>
                <p>The choices shown starting on line two are the fallback choices that will be used if there is no connection available the first time the App is launched (which means that the Client-side Data cache cannot be populated).</p>

            <title>How do I customize the list of forms in the Alpha TransForm app to display additional information, such as an inspection location or client's phone number?</title>
            <description>
                <p>Form listings in Alpha TransForm can be customized to display data from the form. Open the Designer tab and select the Form Type to customize. In the Advanced Features section, edit the Heading Template to customize the forms list in the TransForm App and edit the Listing Template to customize the forms list in the Management Console. Templates are created using HTML markup.</p>
                <p>Your template can reference data in the fields of the form using the {#fieldname} placeholder. For example:</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[Customer Name: {#customerName}<br>
Address:<br>
{#address}<br>
{#city}, {#state}]]></example>

        <section>
            <title>Is there a way to get a list of every field and it's corresponding field name for a form?</title>
            <description>There are several ways to get a list of field names for a Form Type. In the Designer, on the Management Console, or using the Alpha TransForm API.</description>
            <cases>
                <case>
                    <title nested="2">In the Designer</title>
                    <description>Select the Form Type from the list in the Designer and click 'Edit Form Commands'. In the left-most column, you will see a list of every command in the form including "field" commands. Each field command lists a summary of information here, including the field type, it's field name, the field Title, and it's preview value (if one is specified) in the following format:</description>
                </case>
                <case>
                    <content><![CDATA[
<strong>field</strong> <em>fieldType</em> fieldName / "fieldTitle" (fieldPreviewValue)
                    ]]></content>
                </case>
                <case>
                    <description>For example, in the Pumpjack Inspection sample form, the Pumpjack ID field appears as shown below in the command list:</description>
                </case>
                <case>
                    <content><![CDATA[
<strong>field</strong> <em>list</em> PumpjackID / "Pumpjack ID" (value2)
                    ]]></content>
                </case>
                <case>
                    <description>To reference the field, it is expressed as #fieldname. For example:</description>
                    <example><![CDATA[#PumpjackID]]></example>
                    <important>*[Case matters.]* The field name must match case exactly as it is defined in the Field property for a field command.</important>
                </case>
                <case>
                    <description>Field can be used in [Heading Templates] and [Listing Templates] to display additional information (such as a customer's name) in the form lists. They can also be used in expressions (such as IF commands) to add dynamic behaviors  to a form.</description>
                </case>
                <case>
                    <title nested="2">On the Management Console</title>
                    <description>You can get a list of form fields from the Quick Input editor. In the Management Console, select the Form Type you wish to get a list of fields for. Then, click the *[ui:+]* Add Form button. Click the "Quick Input" option when prompted. This opens the Quick Input editor. Clicking the "Fields" button at the bottom of the editor will insert a list of all fields for the form using the following format:</description>
                    <example><![CDATA[fieldTitle (fieldname):]]></example>
                </case>
                <case>
                    <description>You can copy-paste the inserted fields to a text editor such as notepad to use as reference where needed.</description>

                <case>
                    <title nested="2">Using the Alpha TransForm API</title>
                    <description>The GetFieldsInForm API method can be used to retrieve a list of form fields for a specified Form Type from an Alpha TransForm account. See the [GetFieldsInForm method] documentation for more information.</description>

            <title>What is TPL?</title>
            <description>
                <p>TPL (TransForm Programming Language) is a traditional programming language tuned to the needs of TransForm forms.</p>
                <p>TPL code is used in TransForm in two main ways: Standalone expressions to calculate values for display or condition testing and multi-line functions to respond to events such as field value changes or to be called in expressions or other functions. </p>

To do this, go to the Designer tab, select the form design to wish to customize, click *[ui:Advanced Features]* to display the advanced options for the form type. Locate the *[ui:Enable custom code for this form type]* property and select "Yes". Finally, click the *[ui:Edit Custom Code]* link to open the TPL Code Editor.</p>

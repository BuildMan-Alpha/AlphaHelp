                  <p>Alpha TransForm is useful for capturing data through a form-like interface, often on mobile devices. There are times, though, when there is a need to use a custom web interface to create, view, or edit form instances where the TransForm UI is only a part of the interface. For example, an application may display information from a database where the TransForm form instance is only part of the data being used and displayed. When using the application, it may be necessary to display the form instance as a TransForm form, and maybe even allow editing of the data through the TransForm UI, all on the same screen and browser tab as the rest of the application.</p>
                  <p>As functionality to facilitate such use, TransForm QuickLink may be loaded into an &lt;IFRAME&gt; HTML element in another web application. An IFRAME element enables the embedding of another HTML page into the current one. The other application can use the framed QuickLink to view and edit form instances in a coordinated way. This is documentation about that use.</p>
                  <p>This documentation assumes familiarity with Alpha TransForm and the more direct use of QuickLink for accessing form instances through a web link provided to the user that is documented elsewhere, as well as familiarity with web technologies including HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.</p>

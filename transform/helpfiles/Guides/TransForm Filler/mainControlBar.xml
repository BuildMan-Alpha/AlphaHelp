          <title>Menu Choice: Duplicate Form</title>
            <description>
              <p>To create a copy of the selected form, including copies of its associated media files, and then select that new form on the Forms List, tap the [menu] Menu button and then tap the *[Duplicate Form]* menu item. Duplicating a form requires confirmation. The new form will have the current date/time as its creation date/time. </p>
              <p>Forms that have Upload Errors that prevent them from being uploaded can usually be duplicated to create a new form that is more likely able to be uploaded. See "Errors during uploading" in the [Downloading, Refreshing, and Uploading] help.</p>

            <title>Menu Choice: Delete form</title>
            <description><p>
        To delete the selected form and all of its data, tap the [menu] Menu button and then tap the
        *[Delete Form]* menu item. Deleting a form requires confirmation. There is no "undelete".
      </p>
      <p>
        Forms that have not yet been uploaded will be deleted immediately. Forms that already have been uploaded to the server will
        be deleted on the server the next time uploading is performed. Such "waiting to delete" forms will be marked with
        a black left border in the Forms List. However, logging out without performing an upload operation will not delete
        the form on the server and it will be re-downloaded on the next login.

            <title>Menu Choice: Confirm login</title>
            <description><p>
        To confirm login credentials, tap the [menu] Menu button and then tap the
        *[Confirm login]* menu item. This is used when a user has been logged in more than a specific amount of time (for
        example, two days) and the system requires re-confirmation before allowing uploading or downloading of data. A user
        who is already logged in can still create new forms and do editing but may not save that data back to the server
        until confirmation is done successfully. The app will display a prompt when confirmation is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confirmation of login requires the device to be online since it communicates with the server.
      </p></description>
        <note>Logging out and then logging in again will lose any data that has not been uploaded. Use confirmation instead, which maintains the same login and does not erase the data.</note>

            <title>Menu Choice: Logout</title>
            <description><p>
        To logout the current user, tap the [menu] Menu button and then tap the
        *[Logout]* menu item. The user will then be prompted to login again, optionally with a different User ID and/or account.
      </p></description>
      <note>Logging out will lose any data that has not been uploaded (a warning will be displayed). To not lose the data, but
        confirm login credentials, use the Confirm Login menu item instead, which maintains the same login and does not erase
        the data.</note>

            <title>Sorting and filtering the list</title>
            <description><p>
        The [sort] Sort button displays a menu for specifying how the Forms List is ordered and and filtered. By default, all forms are listed
        in the order in which they were created, indicated by the
        *[Date]* item on the menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        The menu choices are:
      </p></description>
            <cases>
                <case>
                    <title nested="2">Date</title>
                    <description><p>
                Sort by date/time created, with most recent last.
              </p></description>
                </case>
                <case>
                    <title nested="2">Status</title>
                    <description><p>
                Group by the Status of the form, then by date/time created within the group. New forms usually start out with a status of
                "Open" or something similar. Once a form has been submitted, it may have a different status, such as "Submitted".
                The set of particular statuses are dependent upon the TransForm account and settings assigned by the form
                type designer.
              </p></description>
                </case>
                <case>
                    <title nested="2">Form</title>
                    <description><p>
                Group by the Form Type name, then by date/time created within the group.
              </p></description>
                </case>

            <description><p>
        When the Forms List is grouped by Status and/or Form there is an option to hide (collapse: [collapse]) or or show (expand: [expand]) each group. Tap on the hide/show buttons or double-tap on the group header row to toggle.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are buttons to
        *[Show All]* and
        *[Hide All]* groups on the Sort menu.

            <title>Edit</title>
            <description><p>
        The Edit button may be used to initiate editing of the currently selected form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, editing may be initiated by double-tapping on the form row or press and holding on the row.

            <title>Help</title>
            <description><p>
        The [help] Help button brings up the Help screen displaying help about what is currently on the screen. On the Help screen the
        *[Show TOC]* button may be used to display the Table of Contents to navigate to any other part of Help. After navigating
        to another part of Help, the
        *[Back]* button may be used to traverse back to the previously displayed parts of Help.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you
        *[press and hold]* on the the [help] Help button, the help will go directly to the Table of Contents.

        The [menu] Menu button on the top-right of the Form Details displays the Form Details Menu to access commands specific to the form:
        *[em:Change Status]*,
        *[em:List Problems]*,
        *[em:List Upload Errors]*,
        *[em:Comments]*, and

            <title>Change Status</title>
            <description>
                <p>
        Each instance of a form has a current "status" (such as "Open" or "Submitted"). The Change Status command displays a list
        of statuses that the form may be assigned by the logged-in user. Tap the row corresponding to the desired status.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the status has been changed but the form has not yet been uploaded, a row for reverting to the original status will be
        included in the list.
      </p>

            <description>
                <p>
        If there are required fields with missing values, or if certain conditions specific to the form type are detected, the List
        Problems command will be enabled. Selecting this command will bring up a list of the problems that were detected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tapping a listed problem will navigate the form details to the corresponding location on the form.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there are any problems with the form, enabling this command, a red [redStar] star will be displayed at the top of the form details after the form name.

            <title>List Upload Errors</title>
            <description>
                <p>
        When errors are detected with forms being uploaded, the List Upload Errors command will be enabled. It displays a list of
        the errors. Some errors, such as write-conflict errors, may provide an action to respond to the errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forms that have upload errors are displayed in the Forms List with a red left edge.
      </p>

            <title>Comments</title>
            <description>
                <p>
        The Comments command displays the Comments List. The list shows the comments, if any, that have been associated with the
        current form instance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The comments are listed in reverse chronological order. On the Form Filler, this is a read-only list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comments are usually added to a form manually through the Management Console or under program control through use of the
        TransForm API.
      </p>

            <title>History Back</title>
            <description>
                <p>
        The History Back command steps the Form Details position back through the steps you have taken to navigate, including some
        scrolling, use of the Form Table of Contents, page navigation through page buttons, and navigation through other
        buttons. One step back is made each time the command is executed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Form Details Menu will not close for each step. You will need to tap either on the [menu] Menu button or to the left of the menu itself to dismiss the menu.

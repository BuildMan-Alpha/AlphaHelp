         <p>Functionality was added to support browser-based execution of the Form Filler comparable to mobile app usage. Map image shown for Location fields now require the user to have a non-expired login. This upgrade also supports newer WebView functionality on mobile devices, which is mainly an internal change. Various display and other issues were fixed, including better handling of invalid layout specifications and date/time editor year width. Added new ajaxSendRequestFromServer() TPL function.</p>

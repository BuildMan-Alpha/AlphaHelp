        <p>The form rows now have the "form color" as a thick border on the left side instead of the whole background. The icon and indicators remain the same. The currently selected form (usually the one just edited) is shown with a darker drop shadow. The row indicators for new (blue), unsaved (orange), deleted on the device but not yet deleted on the server (black), and synchronization error (red) are now colors added to the right corners of the row. The default icon (if none is selected by the form designer) is no icon, and the default left-border color is white.</p>
        <p>The tabs for switching between existing forms and a list of forms to add has been replaced by the "Add Form" button. The Help (?) button has moved into the menu. </p>
        <p>There are new buttons to Search and Filter the lists. By default, they allow searching for forms by form name, as well as filtering to just show forms that are unsaved or have certain errors. Searching and filtering may be customized by the account administrator to provide searching and filtering on other form values. See [Search, Sort, Filter] help for more information. </p>
        <p>The button to sort the list of existing forms has moved down to be in line with the new search and filter buttons. The Edit button is no longer needed, since you can just tap a row once to open the form for edit, and has been removed. </p>
        <p>Fixed various bugs and other issues. </p>

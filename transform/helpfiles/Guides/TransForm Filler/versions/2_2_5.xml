    <topic>Version 2.2.5</topic>
    <description>
        <p>Forms may be opened for viewing and editing with just a single tap instead of requiring a double-tap or press-and-hold as before. </p>
        <p>The Form Details Menu has been modified: The new Form Actions menu item brings up a sub-menu with the Change Status command as well as a Delete Form command and a new Reset Form command (for recovering from some uploading errors). The List Problems command now lists Upload Errors as well as Missing Required Fields and other form data errors. The List Upload Errors command has been removed. </p>
        <p>This version also includes some bug fixes and some internal improvements as well as some new functionality to facilitate testing. </p>

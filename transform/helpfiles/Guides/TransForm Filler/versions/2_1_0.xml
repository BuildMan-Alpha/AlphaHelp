    <topic>Version 2.1.0</topic>
    <description>New editors were added for annotating images, creating drawings, scanning bar code, and capturing date and time information.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>Photos now may be annotated with "ink", including support for "zoomed writing" for better precision and writing on plain, lined, and graph "paper". See these Help topics: [Photo Editor] and [Ink Drawing Screen].</p>
        <p>The following editors have been added: [Stopwatch Editor], [Time Now Editor], and [Scanner Editor]. The [Numeric Field Editor] now also supports a Currency keypad to better handle values with two decimal places.</p>
        <p>Countdown Timers have been added to schedule a notification within the app when a specified amount of time has passed. See [Countdown Timer Help].</p>
        <p>A variety of fixes elsewhere in the app were also made, including to handling of new photos, display of form created date/time, and to Instant Update. This version requires an update of the full installed app.</p>

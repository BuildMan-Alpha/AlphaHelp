        <p>This is a major upgrade. Support was added for an initial release of TPL. TPL is a means by which a form designer can specify additional behavior of a TransForm form as the user fills it in, making possible much more capable form types. Support was also added for On-Device Data specific to each account along with TPL support for making use of that data. These features are used by the form designer and should not require any new training for the user of this app.</p>

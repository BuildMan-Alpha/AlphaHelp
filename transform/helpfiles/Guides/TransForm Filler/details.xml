            <title>About the Form Details</title>
            <description><p>
        The Form Details displays the contents of a form instance. It shows the fields and their current values, optional descriptive
        and help information specific to that type of form, and lets you fill in values for the fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a menu bar at the top of the screen. Below the menu bar is the contents of the form. The contents start with a banner
        with the display name and other information for the type of form being filled out, similar to the row in the Existing
        Forms list.
      </p>
      <p>
        The form contents may optionally consist of more than the initial scrolling page, with one or more sub-pages with their own
        content.

            <title>Form Contents</title>
            <description>The parts of the contents are:</description>
            <list bullet="true">
                <item>
                    <name>*[Informative text]* to indicate logical grouping of fields, instructional material, as well as warning or
              errors. These have no functional capabilities other than being displayed.</name>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>*[Fields]* with a description and a current value. You provide values for a field by tapping on it to
              *[switch to an "editor" for specifying the value]* or, in some cases, by interacting with buttons right below
              the description, such as to select a choice in a button list field. Fields may also have an optional [help] help button that displays help information when tapped.</name>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>*[Action Buttons]* to switch to another page, jump to a particular place in the form contents, or initiate
              uploading of the current form contents to the server when tapped.</name>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>[toc] *[Form Table of Contents button]* to switch to a compact list of all parts of the form for quick navigation.
              See the
              [Form Table of Contents] help for more information.</name>

        Editors are screens used to specify the value of a field. For example, when a number field in the form contents is tapped
        a screen will be displayed with a keypad for entering the value.

            <title>Menu Bar</title>
            <description>The menu bar at the top of the Form Details screen has three parts:</description>
            <list bullet="true">
                <item>
                    <name>Either [done]*[Done]* or [back]*[Back]* to, respectively, end editing and return to the Forms List or to return from a page on the form to
              the main form contents or enclosing page.</name>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>*[Form name]* in the center. If there are any problems with the form, such as missing required fields or validation
              errors, a red [redStar] star will be displayed after the form name and the List Problems command will be enabled on the Form Details Menu.</name>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>[menu] *[Menu]* button to display the Form Details Menu to access commands specific to this form:
              *[em:Change Status]*,
              *[em:List Problems]*,
              *[em:List Upload Errors]*,
              *[em:Comments]*, and
              *[em:History Back]*. (See the
              [Form Details Menu] help for more information.)</name>
                </item>
            </list>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description><p>
        Under the button in the upper-left of the screen one or more short, horizontal bars are displayed. Each bar corresponds to
        going one level deeper of pages, starting with one bar when the main form detail contents is displayed.

                <p>
                    <list bullet="true">
                        <item>
                            <name>Access to On-device Data: on-device data cannot be downloaded to the browser and is unavailable. You can access images, however, if hosted on an external server. See [Adding a cloudpath Policy to display assets in the Web Filler] to learn more.</name>
                        </item>
                        <item>

                        </item>
                        <item>
                            <name>GPS functions: values returned by the browser depend on the computer's IP address, which may not return the user's actual location.</name>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                            <name>ajaxGET() function: calls using this function may fail in the browser filler. Use ajaxSendRequest() or ajaxSendRequestFromServer(). See [Calling Web Services in TransForm Forms from the Web Filler] for more information about using ajaxSendRequestFromServer().</name>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                            <name>On-device Data TPL Functions are unavailable: this includes phoneGapTFExecuteSQL(), inappbrowser(), and fileviewer().</name>
                        </item>

                            <name>phonecall() TPL function: calls may only be made from the web filler in browsers that have been configured to use a specific application to make phone calls and support opening an app to make the call.</name>
                        </item>
                    </list>

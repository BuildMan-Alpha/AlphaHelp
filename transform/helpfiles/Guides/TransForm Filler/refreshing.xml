        This app performs almost all of its operations using only the device's hardware and data resident on the device. It only
        communicates with the TransForm server using WiFi or cellular data when you direct it to. This section of Help addresses
        that communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are four main situations when the app communicates with the server:

            <title>Validating login credentials</title>
            <description><p>
        This app requires you to login with a valid user ID (usually an email address) and password to an existing account for which
        you are authorized. During the validation process the app communicates with the TransForm server to check the ID/password
        combination and to determine the valid accounts for that user. If you are authorized to use more than one account,
        you will be prompted to choose which one to use each time you login. You may only be logged in to one account at
        a time. You usually stay logged in to that account as that user until you logout, even if you exit and restart the
        app.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the app needs to communicate with the server after too much time has elapsed since you last validated your login (for
        example, two days), then you will be prompted to confirm your login by providing your password before those operations
        that require the server are performed. Other operations (such as creating and adding data to forms) may be performed
        without requiring confirmation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confirming login is done using the
        *[Confirm login]* menu choice on the Main Control Bar shown above the List of Forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        To discontinue being logged in as a particular user and account, use the
        *[Logout]* menu choice on the Main Control Bar. You will then need to do a full login to resume using the app for
        forms data capture or viewing.

            <title>Downloading or refreshing form type definitions</title>
            <description><p>
        The definitions for each form type needs to be downloaded from the server. Each account has its own list of form types and
        they may be updated by the account administrator from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Definitions for the form types are automatically downloaded when a user logs in to an account. Those form types are listed
        on the Add Form list on the List of Forms screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish to refresh those definitions, downloading any new or changed form types, you may tap the
        *[Refresh Definitions]* button above the Add Form list. Refreshing is normally not needed unless form type definitions
        are changed or new ones added. This will probably depend upon the particular account and form types. (Refreshing
        or downloading is not automatically performed when you confirm login. Definitions are only automatically downloaded
        on a full login.)

            <title>Uploading forms</title>
            <description><p>
        Forms must be uploaded to the server at some point to be used by the rest of the TransForm system. The user initiates the
        uploading either by tapping a button on the List of Forms or a button on the form itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there are any new, modified, or deleted forms, the Existing Forms list on the List of Forms may include an
        *[Upload Now]*
        button above the list. (If the device is offline - for example, in Airplane Mode - the button will be replaced
        with an "Offline" indicator.) Tapping the button will initiate uploading of all new and modified forms to the server.
      </p>
      <p>
        New, modified, or deleted forms are considered "unsaved" until uploaded to the server. (Uploading a deleted form causes the
        form to be deleted on the server as well as on the device.) If there are unsaved forms, a notice will be displayed
        above the list along with a "Show" button to filter the displayed list to only show unsaved forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        A form may optionally include one or more buttons to initiate saving on the server. This is usually coupled with changing
        the status of the form. A form's status usually starts out with something like "Open" and may be changed to "Submitted",
        "Closed", or some other status determined by the form type designer.

            <title>Downloading existing forms</title>
            <description><p>
        If there are no unsaved forms, a
        *[Refresh]* button may appear above the Existing Forms list on the List of Forms. Tapping this will initiate downloading
        additions and changes to forms assigned to the logged in user for the logged in account. A display to the left of
        the button will indicate how long it has been since checking was last done with the server for such changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This refresh capability is only needed in cases where new forms assigned to the user are added by others (such as a supervisor)
        or changes are made (such as returning a submitted form for more information, optionally with comments explaining
        what is needed).

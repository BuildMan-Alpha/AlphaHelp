            <title>About the Forms List</title>
            <description><p>
        The Forms List screen displays instances of forms. These are forms that are ready to be filled out, partially filled out,
        or completed but still available for viewing and perhaps modification.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Forms List is, by default, listed in chronological order of creation. That is, the oldest forms will be displayed last.
        The list may optionally be sorted and filtered by form
        *[status]* and/or form
        *[type]*.

            <title>The form rows</title>
            <description><p>
        Each row in the list represents one instance of a particular type of form. The display name of that type of form is shown
        in large bold type. The icon associated with the form type will be shown on the left and the associated color background
        will be used for the row. The date/time when the form instance was first created will be shown above the display
        name. If there are any issues with the form (such as missing required fields or detected validation errors) a red [redStar] star will be displayed after the date/time. (Information about any issues is available when viewing the form details through
        a menu item.) A blue [blueDot] dot indicates that the form was changed in a recent Refresh from the server. The current status of the form (for example,
        "Open") will be displayed on the upper-right of the row.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some types of forms display additional information below the display name, such as the value of certain form fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        The left edge of the colored part of the row may optionally have a different color:

            <description><p>
        Tapping the row for a particular form will select it for viewing, editing, or deletion. Selection is shown as a slightly
        wider display on the row. After returning to the Forms List screen from viewing or editing a form, that form will
        remain selected in the list.

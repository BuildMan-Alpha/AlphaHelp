        <p>Occasionally, Alpha TransForm will have a System Message that users of this app may need to see. An example of a message would be prior notification of scheduled brief unavailability of the online service because of maintenance. Such messages should be infrequent and not something you will encounter very often.</p>
        <p>The message will be automatically retrieved and displayed over the normal screen display. Once dismissed, that message will still be available in the help for the TransForm App in the *[TransForm System Message]* section.</p>
        <p>You can reset the information and initiate an immediate attempt to retrieve the current system message within the TransForm app help. The message will not show up in the Help until the help is refreshed (using the *[ui:Refresh Help page]* tool) or viewed again.</p>

    <description>Choosing alternative determinations of the size class of the screen for displaying forms.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>Some types of forms may be designed to display fields and headings differently depending upon the width of the screen. For example, instead of each field being displayed one below the other, a form may show two fields next to each other horizontally when a device is wide or oriented horizontally. </p>
        <p> The different screen widths are classified as one of *[S]*, *[M]*, *[L]*, and *[XL]*, with S (small) being a small phone held vertically (portrait) and XL (extra-large) being a larger device like a tablet held horizontally (landscape). </p>
        <p>Normally, the determination of the screen width class is done automatically. However, there may be situations on some devices where you wish to control that determination.</p>
        <p>You can find out what the *[automatically]* determined screen size is for your device in the *[ui:Multiple Screen Size Support]* help section in the Alpha TransForm application on the device.</p>
        <p>You *[manually]* control the screen size in the *[ui:Multiple Screen Size Support]* help section in the Alpha TransForm application on the device. Separate overrides can be set for when the device is in *[portrait]* and *[landscape]* orientation. Set the override to *[Auto]* to cancel the override.</p>

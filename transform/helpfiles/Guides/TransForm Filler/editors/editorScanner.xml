                <p>The Scanner Editor lets you use the device's camera to scan and enter the value of a one or two-dimensional barcode such as a UPC code, QR code, etc. </p>
                <p>If the field does not already have a value, accessing the Scanner Editor from the form details screen will bring up the device's camera screen with an overlay showing the area in which barcode detection is being performed. When a barcode is detected in that area, a tone will be emitted from the speaker and the camera screen will be removed and the Scanner Editor screen will be shown with the captured value at the top. If the *[Cancel]* button at the bottom of the scanning photo screen is tapped before a barcode is detected, the scanning will be canceled and the Scanner Editor screen will be displayed with the field value unchanged. </p>
                <p>The Scanner Editor includes two buttons. The *[Scan]* button will bring up the camera screen to scan for a new value. The *[Clear]* button will set the field value to blank. </p>

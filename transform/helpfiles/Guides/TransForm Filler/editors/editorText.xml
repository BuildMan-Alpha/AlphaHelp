        The Text Field Editor is used to enter text values using the normal device keyboard. It displays a textbox in which you can
        tap to position the type-in cursor and bring up the keyboard and it has a [clear] *[Clear]* button to erase all of the contents.
      </p>
      <p>
        On smaller devices, in landscape orientation the textbox and buttons at the top of the screen may be rearranged to help keep
        them on the screen when the keyboard is displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two textbox configurations: A
        *[single-line textbox]* for single-line input in which the Return key on the keyboard will be treated as "confirm
        input and advance to next field", and a larger
        *[multi-line text area]* for entering text that may span multiple lines. In the multi-line configuration, the Return
        key inserts a line break into the text like in regular text editing apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the multi-line configuration, there is a vertical scroller on the right side of the text area. Dragging the scroller's
        rectangle will scroll the contents of the text area if it is longer than will fit in the text area space alone.

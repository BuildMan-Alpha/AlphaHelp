                <p>Time Now fields are used to easily capture the current date and time. The time may be captured by tapping on a button either right on the form details screen or on a larger one on an editor screen. </p>
                <p>Time Now fields differ from Date/Time fields in that they have a precision to the second and may be set on the form details screen, while the Date/Time fields are only to the minute and require going to an editor screen to set. </p>
                <p>*[Pressing and holding]* on a Time Now field in the form details screen will switch to showing the Time Now Editor Screen without changing the value of the field. </p>

            <description>
                <p>Time Now fields may optionally include a Countdown Timer button. In that case, tapping the button will set the value of the field to the current time and then start a Countdown Timer. See [Countdown Timers Help] for more information about Countdown Timers</p>

        The Numeric Field Editor is used to enter text values made up of numeric characters (0 through 9, and optionally "." and
        "–"). It displays a box at the top with the current value and a large keypad below for entering and editing
        the value. There are several configurations for different types of values.
      </p>
      <p>
        All input and editing is done using the keys on the keypad. The digit buttons (
        *[0]* through
        *[9]*) add digits to the right of the current value.
        *[AC]* button (All Clear) clears the current value (to a blank field for phone numbers and zero for all other configurations).
        The [bspace] *[backspace]* button deletes the rightmost character from the value. The
        *[+/-]* toggles the value between positive and negative. The
        *[Done]* button confirms the value and returns to the form details screen. The
        *[–]* button adds a "–" to the value, such as for a phone number.

                <description><p>

            <p>
              On the
              *[form details]* screen, just under the value displayed,
              *[additional buttons]* are provided to quickly change the value without needing to bring up an editor. There
              are buttons to
              *[add]* 1 or 10 to, or
              *[subtract]* 1 or 10 from, the value.

        The Location Editor lets you access the device's GPS capabilities to determine the current location and fill the field with
        a "latitude,longitude" value. If there is a current value, and the device has connectivity to the Internet, a small
        part of a map is displayed showing the location.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a
        *[Get Location]* button on the editor to issue a command to the device to use its hardware and various software to
        get the current location.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help get an accurate value for the current location, the device GPS functionality may take several seconds after pushing
        the button to refine where it thinks it is before returning a value that will then be entered into the field. The
        app gives that functionality up to 20 seconds to make the determination. A display of progress will be updated every
        second while this is occurring.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the location cannot be determined, the field will be set to a blank value.

        The Signature Editor lets you capture a handwritten signature drawn on the screen with a finger or stylus.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the field does not already have a signature as a value, accessing the Signature Editor will display a yellow area centered
        vertically on the screen in which to write. When done writing, tap the
        *[Done]* button at the bottom of the screen to commit the value and return to the form details. To
        *[erase]* what you have written and start with a blank signature, tap the [eraser] eraser button at the bottom of the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        When entering a signature, swiping left or right on the white areas above and below the signature area will commit the value
        and then change to the next/previous field's editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you display the Signature Editor when the field already has a signature value, the signature and timestamp will be displayed
        towards the top of the editor screen. Double-tapping on an existing signature will erase the value and display the
        signature writing area.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also use the [delete] delete button at the bottom of the screen to delete the current field value.
      </p>
      <p>
        When previewing a signature, swiping left or right on the editor screen will change to the next/previous field's editor.

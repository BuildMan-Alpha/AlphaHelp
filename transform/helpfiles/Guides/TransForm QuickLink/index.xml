                    <p>Many types of workflow involve sending a message to an individual to have them click on a link and automatically view a single form, often answering questions such as giving approval, and then submitting that form for further action. The TransForm QuickLink functionality provides this capability.</p>
                    <p>Other parts of TransForm, like the Filler and Management Console, require the user to run them and then locate or create an appropriate form instance and work with it along with a list of other form instances and types of forms. This general purpose operation does not easily fit into those link-driven types of workflows and is cumbersome in those cases.</p>
                    <p>QuickLink also makes it easy to send a link to a user that includes custom data to pre-populate parts of a form before editing. For example, an email created from a template can include template data fields in the URL which are in turn passed to the form.</p>
                    <p>Another example of using QuickLink is an intranet web page that uses simple Javascript to create a URL that any authorized user can click on, log in with their credentials (if they are not already logged in), and have a new form instance created using custom initialization data (such as a work order number). The user can then fill in the rest of the form and then submit it – all in just a few clicks.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>Using QuickLink to view and edit a form instance is similar to using the TransForm Filler once a particular form instance is chosen. Only the Form Details screens and Editors are shown. Unlike the Web Filler, there is no Forms List with QuickLink nor an Add a Blank Form list.</p>
                    <p>Unlike the Mobile Filler but similar to the Web Filler, QuickLink runs in a browser connected to the Internet. It is launched by going to a custom URL, usually from an email, text message, QR code, or web page. Once launched, it supports the viewing, editing, and saving of a single form instance. The link includes special information to identify the desired form instance. Optionally, the link can specify initial automatic positioning of the view of the form to a specific field or section.</p>
                    <p>QuickLink, once invoked, requires login with user name, password, and account credentials which persist in the browser during subsequent sessions. Multiple tabs in a browser may be open at once, all running different QuickLink URLs to edit different form instances.</p>
                    <p>Once a form instance has been displayed for viewing and/or edit, the user may quit the tab without saving. Once edits have been made, a “Save” button will be enabled in the upper left above the form. Pressing that button, or pressing a form button that executes a “save” operation, will upload the form instance data and switch to a final screen.</p>

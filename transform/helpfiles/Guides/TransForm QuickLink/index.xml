                    <p>Many types of workflow involve sending a message to an individual to have them click on a link and automatically view a single form, often answering questions such as giving approval, and then submitting that form for further action. The TransForm QuickLink functionality provides this capability.</p>
                    <p>Other parts of TransForm, like the Filler and Management Console, require the user to run them and then locate or create an appropriate form instance and work with it along with a list of other form instances and types of forms. This general purpose operation does not easily fit into those link-driven types of workflows and is cumbersome in those cases.</p>
                    <p>QuickLink also makes it easy to send a link to a user that includes custom data to pre-populate parts of a form before editing. For example, an email created from a template can include template data fields in the URL which are in turn passed to the form.</p>
                    <p>Another example of using QuickLink is an intranet web page that uses simple Javascript to create a URL that any authorized user can click on, log in with their credentials (if they are not already logged in), and have a new form instance created using custom initialization data (such as a work order number). The user can then fill in the rest of the form and then submit it â€“ all in just a few clicks.</p>

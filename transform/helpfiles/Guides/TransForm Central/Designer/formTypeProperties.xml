                    <description>
                        <p>The Basic Info section of the Form Properties Screen lets you set the Display Name and the Form ID.</p>
                        <p>The Display Name is shown in lists and on Tabs to indicate the title of forms of that form type. It usually should not be too long (less than 20 characters or so), since it may appear in the top of a phone, etc. Longer descriptions can go on the form itself using Heading commands.It does not need to be unique as form types are distinguished in the system by unique Form IDs, not Display Name. Form types may be distinguished to the user through use of different icons and colors in the Form Tab, and users with different roles may only see a subset of the form types for an account. Examples are: "Form 1040-EZ", "Post-assembly Check".</p>
                        <p>The Form ID is a short, unique name to distinguish this form type from all other form types in this account. A name is automatically provided when a form type is first created but it may be changed. Filled-out forms automatically include this Form ID in their data to associate the data with the form type definition. (Changing the Display Name does not affect the association of existing forms and their data with a form type.   Only the Form ID has that effect.)</p>

                    <description>
                        <p>New form types may have the commands that define the fields of that type of form initially entered using a simple method made up of lines of text. You do this by clicking the "Input Quickstart Text" button.</p>
                        <p>Quickstart Text looks like this:  </p>
                    </description>

                        <p>See the Help section on [Quickstart Text] for a detailed description of what to enter. There is also extensive help on the screen when entering Quickstart Text.</p>
                        <p>The button may only be used on the Form Properties Screen when a form type is first defined and   has no commands. It will be disabled when it is no longer applicable. Once you have started a form type definition you can add additional items to a form type using the Command List. One of the options there lets you insert additional commands using the Quickstart Text method.</p>

                        <p>The next set of Form Properties may require more technical skill than the ones above. Form Types may be defined without needing to use any of them or at most just the first (Color and Icon). Click the "Advanced Features" button to toggle the display of these properties.</p>

                    <description>
                        <p>The "Set Color and Icon" button brings up a screen to set the Color and Icon properties. These refer to the background and text color, and the icon on the left, of the Form Tab for the form type being defined.</p>
                        <p>A sample Form Tab is displayed below the Save/Cancel buttons which gives you an indication of how the colors and icon you enter will display. The sample includes bars with the colors used to indicate modified, new, deleted, and error conditions so you can check whether or not they will still be visible with the colors you have chosen.</p>

                        <p>There are textboxes for entering color values for the Form Tab background and text. These values must be in CSS format. For example:</p>

                        <p>There is a list of predefined colors in a list below each textbox. You can drag the   list horizontally if it doesn't all fit on the screen. Clicking on a color box will enter that value.</p>
                        <p>The Icon SVG textbox lets you type or paste in the specification for an icon. There are predefined samples on the list below the textbox.</p>
                        <p>The SVG must be represented as text starting with an &lt;SVG&gt; tag. It should have a height and width of no greater than 50. The samples may be edited, such as by editing the "fill" and "stroke" attributes to change colors. SVG may be created using various editing tools or found on libraries on the Internet.</p>

                        <p>This button brings up a screen with a large textbox displaying the current commands defining the fields and headings that make up the form type in their raw, internal JSON format.</p>
                        <p>The raw JSON may be used to copy/paste from one form type to another. It may also be used by a person with appropriate technical skill to make changes to the commands directly in JSON without using the Commands List.</p>

                    <title>Heading Template</title>
                    <description>
                        <p>When a form is listed in the Form Filler app, the Form Tab includes standard text listing the form Display Name as well as the date/time that the blank form instance was first added to the list (the "created" time). A red star is also added if the commands that make up the form definition determine that there is a problem with the entered data or a required field has not been filled in with data.</p>
                        <p>The Heading Template allows the form type designer to specify additional text to be displayed on the Form Tab. That text can include data within the form as well as HTML markup and the results of simple tests and calculations. *[The Heading Template is an advanced feature that is only to be specified by a person with appropriate technical knowledge.]*</p>
                        <p>The template makes use of the powerful Alpha Anywhere templating functionality. The values that may be accessed in that template include: status (open/submitted), created (date/time string), completed (date/time string of when the status was last changed), formname (display name), and data (top-level of an object that consists of the form data, for example "data.field1").</p>
                        <p>For example, the Heading Template below is used to add the Equipment Id (field1) and the working status (field3) to the Heading Listing in the Form Filler App:</p>
                    </description>
                    <example code="cst"><![CDATA[Equipment Id: {data.field1}<br>
Working? {data.field3}]]></example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>
                        <p>If the fields contain a value, they will be displayed in the heading for the form in the Existing Forms tab:</p>
                    </description>

                        <link>/images/headingTemplate.png</link>
                    </figure>
                    <note>You may notice the value for the Equipment Id and working status are missing on one of the forms. This is because the fields do not contain a value.</note>

                    <description>
                        <p>When a form is listed in the Management Console app, the row of information includes standard text listing the Status, dates Created and Changed, and other information. Optional Details may also be displayed through use of the Listing Template.</p>
                        <p>The details text can include data within the form as well as HTML markup and the results of simple tests and calculations. *[The Listing Template is an advanced feature that is only to be specified by a person with appropriate technical knowledge.]*</p>

                        <p>For example, a form that contains a signature field  called "inspectorSignature" could show the signature in the Listing Template using the the template below:</p>

                    <title>Initialization Commands</title>
                    <description>
                        <p>When a form is first created and added to the Form Filler app, values in fields by default are all blank. They may be given initial values by providing commands in the Initialization Commands textbox. Only top-level fields (that is, fields not within a Data Group) may be initialized using this textbox. Fields within a Data Group may be initialized using [commands associated with that Data Group].</p>
                        <p>An initialization command consists of a line of text, one line for each field being initialized. There are three forms:</p>
                    </description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[*[em:fieldname]*:text,*[em:value]*
*[em:fieldname]*:date
*[em:fieldname]*:time]]>

                <section>
                    <description>
                        <p>*[em:Fieldname]* is the name of the field (e.g., "field1", not the Title "User Name"). *[em:Value]* is the text to use as the initial value. The second and third forms set the value to the text value of the current date (e.g., "2017-01-10") or the current date and time (e.g., "2017-01-10 09:55:05").</p>
                        <p>The following example shows how to set the default for a field, "jobStatus", which can have a value of 'open', 'in progress', 'hold', or 'closed':</p>

                <title>Preview Data</title>
                    <description>
                        <p>The Preview Screen displays a preview of a form of the form type with sample data. The data for fields can either be blank, from the Preview Value property associated with the Data Field command (created by default), or from the data in   JSON data in the Preview Data textbox. The Preview Data in the Form Properties, if present, overrides all other preview values. In all cases, the preview information is only used to help a person defining a form visualize and test how the form will look and behave while using the Form Designer.</p>
                        <p>The Preview Data in JSON form is for use by a person with appropriate technical skill. It should be a JSON object where values are either text strings or arrays of objects similar to the top-level.</p>
                        <p>For example, this JSON specifies a single, top-level field named "field1" with a value of   "Sample text", and an array (Data Group) named "array1" with a single item with the fields "field1" and "field2":</p>

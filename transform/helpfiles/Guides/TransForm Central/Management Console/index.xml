        <p>Whenever a TransForm user uploads forms from the TransForm App, they are updated in the Management Console in TransForm Central. The Management Console is where you can view and manage user forms, including adding comments, editing forms, adding new forms, and exporting forms from TransForm Central.</p>

                        <p>If there are no form types listed in the *[ui:Types of Forms]* list, make sure that you have created and saved a form using the [Designer]. If the form type you want to see data for is not listed and was recently added, the Choose Type list needs to be refreshed. The *[ui:Refresh]* link at the bottom of the Choose Type list can be used to refresh the list of form types.</p>

                        <p>The middle column in the Management Console displays the Form contents for the selected form. Data can be shown as Values or JSON. To view the data in JSON format, click the *[ui:JSON]* button. To return to the Values view, click the *[ui:Values]* button while in the JSON view.</p>
                        <p>Data for a form can be edited in both the Values and JSON view. Click the *[ui:Edit]* button to edit the data in the current view. When editing data in JSON mode, if the JSON contains errors, Alpha TransForm will display an error message.</p>

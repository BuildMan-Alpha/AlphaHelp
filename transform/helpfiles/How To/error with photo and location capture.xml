                <p>The first time Alpha TransForm attempts to access the device camera, microphone, or GPS,  you will be asked to give Alpha TransForm permission to use the service. If access is denied, some features in Alpha TransForm will not work. You can give Alpha TransForm access to these services in the settings for your mobile device.</p>

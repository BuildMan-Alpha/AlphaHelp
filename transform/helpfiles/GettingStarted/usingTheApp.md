## Create a New Equipment Inspection Form

When you have logged in, you will see two tabs: Existing Forms and Add Form. Existing Forms displays a list of all of the forms you have filled out. Add Forms is where you can create a new form from a list of Form Types. Let's create a new Equipment Inspection form.


1. Tap Add Form.

    ![Existing Forms](../images/app3.png)

2. On the Add Form tab, you should see the "Equipment Inspection" form you created in TransForm Central. Create a new Equipment Inspection form by tapping the "Equipment Inspection" form.

    ![Add Form](../images/app4.png)

3. After tapping "Equipment Inspection", TransForm will open a new, blank copy of the Equipment Inspection form.

6. Tap the "Equipment Location" field. The location editor captures your current location. To do this, tap the "Get Location" button. Capturing the location can take a little time to get an accurate reading.

    When the process completes, a map will appear with the captured location. If you are in an area with no wifi or cell service, the map won't appear. But don't worry, TransForm will still accurately collect the GPS coordinates.

## Uploading Forms to TransForm Central

So we’ve filled out the form and all of the data is saved on the phone. Now it’s time to upload that data so we can see it in TransForm central.

Before we do, take a look at the the blue line next to the form. The blue indicates this form has not yet been saved to the TransForm cloud.

            <description>
                <p>You can work around this issue by uploading the form using the following methods:</p>
                <p>
                    <list bullet="true">
                        <item>
                            <name>Choose *[Upload All]* after tapping the Change Status button.</name>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                            <name>Change the form's status to Submitted using the hamburger menu option. Then, upload all changes using the *[Upload Changes]* from the main form list.</name>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                </p>

                <p>You can also work around this issue by changing the User permissions as follows:</p>
                <p>
                    <list bullet="true">
                        <item>
                            <name>Change permissions to allow users with the User role to List forms with a Submitted stats in the filler application. Note that users will be able to see Submitted forms in the filler app, which may not be desired.</name>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                </p>

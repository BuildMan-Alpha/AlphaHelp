            <description>Assume you have defined a table with FIRSTNAME, INITIAL, and LASTNAME fields. You want to print a report that displays the name in its proper format (e.g., John S. King). You can do this by defining a calculated field, called FULLNAME, with the following expression:
 </description>
           <example>if(isblank(INITIAL), trim(FIRSTNAME) + " " + LASTNAME, trim(FIRSTNAME) + " " + trim(INITIAL) + ". " + LASTNAME)
</example>

LIKE() returns .T. (TRUE) if Find_String equals Search_In_String ; otherwise, it returns .F. (FALSE).
This function is extremely useful in filter expressions. It is more flexible than the $ operator because it enables you to search for the occurrence of one string at a specific location within another string. For example, the expression LIKE("super*computer*inc.", LOWER(COMPANY)) is TRUE for all company names that meet the following conditions:

 Start with "Super"

 Have the string "computer" anywhere within the name

 End with "Inc." 
 
The Find_String argument is case sensitive.

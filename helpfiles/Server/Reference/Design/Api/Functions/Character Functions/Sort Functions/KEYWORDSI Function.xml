KEYWORDSI() returns a sorted list of all of the unique words in string. This function is typically used to build an index for full text searching. When you build full text indexes on memo fields and other long character fields, Alpha Anywhere can find a word anywhere within long memos and character fields very quickly, using Lightning Query Optimization. Case insensitive.

? keywords("now is the time for all Good Men")
= "all for Good is Men now the time"
? keywords("now is the time for for for all Good Men")
= "all for Good is Men now the time", because only unique words are returned.

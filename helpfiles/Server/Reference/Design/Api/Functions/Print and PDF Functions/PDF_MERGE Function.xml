         <description>Logical. Optional. Default = .T. If Merge_File has fewer pages than Base_File, flagMergeAllPages controls whether Merge_File pages are repeated so that content is merged onto all pages in Base_File.

 .T. = Repeat pages.

   <description>Merge content of Merge_File with Base_File, creating Result_file. Result_file has same number of pages as Base_file. If Merge_file has fewer pages than Base_File, 'flagMergeAllPages' controls whether Merge_file pages are repeated so that content is merged onto all pages in Base_file. If Result_File is blank, then content is merged with Base_File. Note: The 'logo' or 'watermark' file is the 'Merge_File'. </description>
   <discussion>
The PDF_MERGE() function combines Base_File with Merge_File to create Result_File. If Result_File is blank, then content is merged with Base_File. Note: If you are adding a logo or watermark image, it will be the Merge_File.

   <discussion>
BLANK_DUPLICATE() removes repeating instances of a field value that occur in a sequence of two or more records.
The Expression is evaluated for all the records in the Sub_Group that are related to the current record of the Group, and if two or more records have identical expression values.  Only the first record's value is returned; the other duplicate records return a blank (empty) string.
For example, to summarize the line-items in an invoice set, the Group parameter might be GRP  �  >INV_HEAD and the Sub_Group parameter GRP  �  >INV_ITEM.  This means the Summary operation includes only those child records in INV_ITEM related to the current parent record in the Inv_head table.  To summarize all the records in a table or set, use the name GRAND as the Group name. The group GRP  �  >GRAND and sub-group GRP  �  >INV_ITEM produce a summary result based on all invoices.
If you use this summary function in a report layout, the group name can be the name assigned to any of the report's grouping levels.
Limitations: This function is a report writer function, not intended for table level field rules or other expressions. While the function may perform in some areas outside of the Report Editor, its use there is not supported.

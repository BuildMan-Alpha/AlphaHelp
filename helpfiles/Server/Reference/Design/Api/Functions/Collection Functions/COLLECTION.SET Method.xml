   <original><![CDATA[ &ltCOLLECTION>.SET()
Syntax
&ltCOLLECTION>.SET( Key as C,  Data as A )
&ltCOLLECTION>.SET( Key as C,  Data as P )
&ltCOLLECTION>.SET( Key as D, Data as A )
&ltCOLLECTION>.SET( Key as N,  Data as A )
ArgumentDescription
KeyA value (character, numeric or date) that uniquely identifies  an element in a collection.
DataThe data to be saved into the collection element.

Description
The &ltCOLLECTION>.SET() method sets the Data for the specified Key in the specified collection.  If the collection does not have the specified Key,  then the Key is added, and the Data is associated with it. If the Key already  exists, then the data value for that key is changed.
Example
dim mycollection as u
mycollection.SET("FJ","Fred Jones")
mycollection.SET("BB","Bryan Boyd")
mycollection.SET("KL","Kim Lee")
mycollection.SET("KB","Karen Boyd")
mycollection.SET("EL","Erica Loyd")
x = mycollection.enum_all()
? x
= "FJ
BB
KL
KB
EL
"

The "value" that you assign to a collection entry does not  have to be a scalar. It can be a dot variable with multiple children, as shown  in the following example.
dim a as P
dim b as P
dim u as U
a.name = "Fred"
a.city = "Boston"
a.company = "Alpha"
b.name = "Ed"
b.city = "Nashua"
b.company = "Beta"
u.set("Fred", a)
u.set("Ed", b)
? u.get("Ed").company
= "Beta"
? u.get("Fred").city
= "Boston"

Here is an example where the collection elements are numbers.
dim mycollection as u
dim k as N
dim i as N = 1
dim keyval as C
dim currentval as N
mycollection.SET("One",1)
mycollection.SET("Two",2)
mycollection.SET("Three",3)
mycollection.SET("Four",4)
mycollection.SET("Five",5)
k = mycollection.size()
keyval = mycollection.first()
currentval = mycollection.get(keyval)
mycollection.set(keyval, currentval)
ui_msg_box("","Key = " + keyval + "  Data = " + mycollection.get(keyval))
while (i &lt k)
    keyval = mycollection.next(keyval)
    currentval = mycollection.get(keyval)
    mycollection.set(keyval, currentval)
    i = i + 1
    ui_msg_box("","Key  = " + keyval + " Data = " + mycollection.get(keyval))
end while

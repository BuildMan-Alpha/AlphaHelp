       <title>Evaluating the User's Selection</title>
            <description>Whether from a menu bar, icon bar, button, or hot spot, the UI_POPUP_MENU()  function will display a multi-level drop down menu. The UI_POPUP_MENU()  function is an easy and flexible method to create your own menus with  all the richness of a professional looking menu with icon and conditional  capabilities. By default, the function positions the menu at the cursor  location. So putting the UI_POPUP_MENU() function on a button's onPush event will position the menu at the button.  To begin exploring the UI_POPUP_MENU() function, put the following code  on the onPush event of a button placed on a form:

            <example><![CDATA[
vMenuItems = <<%a%
Choice One
Choice Two
Choice Three
%a%
ui_popup_menu(vMenuItems)

       </section>
       
       
       <section>
            <description>The variable, vMenuItems, is a CR-LF delimited  string that contains the menu choices displayed by the UI_POPUP_MENU()  function. 
The above code produces the following drop down menu: </description>

            <description>Normally, you would want to respond to the user's selection, but the  above code does not do this. You can respond to the user's selection either  inside or outside the UI_POPUP_MENU() function. The following syntax demonstrates  handling the users selection within UI_POPUP_MENU() function:
</description>
            <example><![CDATA[
ui_popup_menu(vMenuItems,<<%code%
if a_command = "Choice One"
    ui_msg_box("The User Selected:",a_command)
else
    ui_msg_box("Choice One NOT Selected!","The user did not select Choice One")
end if
%code%)

]]></example>
       </section>
       
       <section>
            <description>The a_command variable is internal to Alpha  Five and holds the user's selection. Checking the value of a_command will reveal the selection, and allow you to process it. For menus with  many choices, you may want to process the user's selection outside of  the UI_POPUP_MENU() function. It really makes no difference, but it may  make the code slightly more readable. The a_command variable is not available outside of the UI_POPUP_MENU() function. Instead,  you evaluate the return value (in this case vPopupReturn ) of the UI_POPUP_MENU() function.
</description>
            <example><![CDATA[
vPopupReturn = ui_popup_menu(vMenuItems)
if vPopupReturn = "Choice One"
    ui_msg_box("The User Selected:",vPopupReturn)
else
    ui_msg_box("Choice One NOT Selected!","The user did not select Choice One")
end if

       <title>Cascading Drop Down Menus</title>
            <description>Assume you want two sub-selections to be available to the user if they  select "Choice One". The following code does this:

            <description>The pipe symbol, "|" on the keyboard (above the backslash),  defines the break between the first and second level menu items. You can  continue to create lower level cascading menu selections as the  following demonstrates:

   <title>Evaluation Issues</title>
            <description>The commands to add icons, and other commands such as {tab},  affect the return value of the UI_POPUP_MENU() function. In the preceding  code, if the user selects "third level selection two", the a_command or the vPopupReturn variables would contain:

            <description>If you prefer a more explicit return value, you can specifically define the return value of a selection by using the ""{data=}" command. Assume you want a value of "Shut Down" returned if the user selects the "third level selection two" choice. Using the command, "{data=Shut Down}" in the following code does this:</description>
            <example><![CDATA[
vMenuItems = <<%a%
{I=$a5_hammer}Choice One | sub-selection One
{I=$a5_hammer}Choice One | sub-selection Two | third level selection one
{I=$a5_hammer}Choice One | sub-selection Two | -
{I=$a5_hammer}Choice One | sub-selection Two | {DATA=Shut Down}{I=$a5_halt}third level selection two

    <title>Enabling and Disabling Menu Entries</title>
            <description>You can conditionally enable or disable any of the menu choices with  the "{enable=}" command. The logical variable vFlag demonstrates this. In the following code vFlag is set to false (.f.) value.  The command "{enable=vFlag}" is immediately in front of "Choice  Two".
</description>
            <example><![CDATA[
dim vFlag as L
vFlag = .F.
vMenuItems = <<%a%
{I=$a5_hammer}Choice One | sub-selection One
{I=$a5_hammer}Choice One | sub-selection Two | third level selection one
{I=$a5_hammer}Choice One | sub-selection Two | -
{I=$a5_hammer}Choice One | sub-selection Two | {DATA=Shut Down}{I=$a5_halt}third level selection two
-
{ENABLE=vFlag}Choice Two {tab}

            <description>As you can see, "Choice Two" is now disabled and grayed out.  Setting the vFlag variable to a true value (.t.)  enables "Choice Two".

   <title>Positioning the Menu</title>
            <description>One last command I want to point out is the "{position}" command.  By default, Alpha Anywhere brings up your menu where ever the cursor is located.  By using the "{position=x,y}" command , where x is the horizontal  axis and y the vertical axis (in inches), you can set where the menu is  displayed. You can also use the constant, "mouse", to use the  current mouse position to replace either the x or y axis. The following  example positions the menu down 2 inches, but directly below the cursor  location.
</description>
            <example><![CDATA[
dim vFlag as L
vFlag = .F.
vMenuItems = <<%a%
{POSITION=mouse,2}{I=$a5_hammer}Choice One | sub-selection One
{I=$a5_hammer}Choice One | sub-selection Two | third level selection one
{I=$a5_hammer}Choice One | sub-selection Two | -
{I=$a5_hammer}Choice One | sub-selection Two | {DATA=Shut Down}{I=$a5_halt}third level selection two

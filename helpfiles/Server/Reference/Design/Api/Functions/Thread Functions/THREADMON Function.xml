The THREADMON() function opens a small window listing the running threads. Takes an optional Refresh_Interval,   which specifies in seconds how often the display should be updated.
 Note : No user interface related commands are allowed in a thread. Using any command that attempts to create or manipulate any type of user interface from within a thread will cause Alpha Anywhere to hang. Examples of such invalid functions include debug() , ui_*, StatusBar.*, ControlPanel.*, trace.*, etc.
Limitations: Desktop applications only.

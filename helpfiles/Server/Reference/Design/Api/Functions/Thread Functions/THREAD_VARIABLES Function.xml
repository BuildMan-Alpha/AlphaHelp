For internal use only. The THREAD_VARIABLES() function returns a pointer to all of the variables of a specific thread. This can be used to peek at what a background thread is doing or to set variables within that thread.
Limitations: Desktop applications only. No user interface related commands are allowed in a thread. Using any command that attempts to create or manipulate any type of user interface from within a thread will cause Alpha Anywhere to hang. Examples of such invalid functions include debug() , ui_*, StatusBar.*, ControlPanel.*, trace.*, etc. .

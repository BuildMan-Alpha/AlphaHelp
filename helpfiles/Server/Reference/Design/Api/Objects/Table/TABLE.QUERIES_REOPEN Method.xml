Syntax
&ltTBL>.QUERIES_REOPEN()
Description
The &ltTBL>.QUERIES_REOPEN() method closes, and then reopens, the table's .MPX files. These are the queries that have been run for the table. This is useful when a query has been run in a different session but with the same table, and you want to bring the current session into synch with the other session.
Example
This script is attached to a button on a form. When the button is pressed, the form's queries reflect queries that were run by another instance of that form.
tbl = table.current()
tbl.queries_reopen()

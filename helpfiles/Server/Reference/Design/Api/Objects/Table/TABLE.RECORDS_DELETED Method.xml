Syntax
Deleted_Records as N = &ltTBL>.RECORDS_DELETED()
Description
The &ltTBL>.RECORDS_DELETED() method returns the number of Deleted_Records in the open table referenced by &ltTBL>.
When records are deleted from a table they are not physically removed from the table. To physically remove deleted records from a table, you must pack the table using the &ltTBL>.PACK() method.
Example
This script packs the table to remove any space taken up by deleted records.
tbl = table.open("c:\a5\a_sports\customer.dbf")
deleted_count = tbl.records_deleted()
if deleted_count > 0 then
    tbl.pack()
end if

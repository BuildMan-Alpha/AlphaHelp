   <discussion><![CDATA[
The <TBL>.MARK() method marks the current record in the table referenced by <TBL>. The table must be in change mode before the record can be marked. Use the <TBL>.CHANGE_BEGIN() method to put the table into change mode. The record is only marked after the <TBL>.CHANGE_END() method is executed.
You can check the mark status of a record using the <TBL>.IS_MARKED() method.
Note : If you are marking records in a set with one-many child links off the parent table in which you are marking records, remember that if referential integrity is enabled, marking a parent record will result in all matching child records being marked as well.

Syntax
&ltTBL>.MARK()
Description
The &ltTBL>.MARK() method marks the current record in the table referenced by &ltTBL>. The table must be in change mode before the record can be marked. Use the <TBL>.CHANGE_BEGIN() method to put the table into change mode. The record is only marked after the <TBL>.CHANGE_END() method is executed.
You can check the mark status of a record using the <TBL>.IS_MARKED() method.
Note : If you are marking records in a set with one-many child links off the parent table in which you are marking records, remember that if referential integrity is enabled, marking a parent record will result in all matching child records being marked as well.
Example
This script marks the current record.
dim tbl as P
tbl = table.current()
tbl.change_begin()
tbl.mark()
tbl.change_end(.T.)

Syntax
&ltTBL>.FIELD_STATISTICS( Expression as C, Statistics as P )
ArgumentDescription
ExpressionAn expression or value that selects some or all of the fields in the table.
StatisticsThe name of the Statistics dot variable that will receive the answers.

Description
The &ltTBL>.FIELD_STATISTICS() method computes statistics (first value, last value, minimum value, count, total, average, standard deviation and variance) for Expression, for all of the currently selected records in the table referenced by &ltTBL>.
The statistics are stored in a Statistics dot variable. For example, the command:
tbl.field_statistics("amount_due", answer)

creates dot variables such as: answer.count, answer.total, answer.maximum etc. The following dot variables are created:
Dot VariableDescriptionCreated for Expression Types
.countNumber of records in current index/query listAll
.minimumMinimum value in field/expressionAll
.maximumMaximum value in field/expressionAll
.firstValue of field/expression in first record in current selection of recordsAll
.lastValue of field/expression in last record in current selection of recordsAll
.totalTotal of field/expression for all records in current selection of records.Numeric only
.averageAverage of field/expression for all records in current selection of records.Numeric only
.standardStandard deviation of field/expression for all records in current selection of records.Numeric only
.varianceVariance of field/expression for all records in current selection of records.Numeric only

Example
This script is attached to a button on a form. It computes the field statistics for the amount_due field.
dim tbl as P
'initialize the "answer" dot variable
answer.count = 0
tbl = table.current()
tbl.field_statistics("amount_due",answer)
ui_msg_box("Answer","Count: " + answer.count + CRLF()+ "Total: " + answer.total)

If you wanted to compute statistics for just customers in "MA".
dim tbl as P
tbl = table.current()
query.filter = "state = 'ma'"
i = tbl.query_create()
'initialize the "answer" dot variable
answer.count = 0
tbl.field_statistics("amount_due",answer)
ui_msg_box("Answer","Count: " + answer.count + CRLF()+ "Total: " + answer.total)

Syntax
Result_Flag as L = &ltTBL>.QUERY_FROM_RANGE()
Description
The &ltTBL>.QUERY_FROM_RANGE() method converts the current range into a query. A query is static, whereas a range is dynamic. You might want to convert a range to a query so as to get a count of the number of records in a range, or to prevent the range of records from changing dynamically. Result_Flag is .T. if the query was successfully created (i.e. a range was in effect), and is .F. if the query was not created (i.e. there was no range in effect).
Example
Assume that the user has set a range using the Lastname index and selected a first key of "Higgins" and a last key of "Jones" This script is attached to a button on a form. It displays a count of the records in the range.
parentform:Tables:Customer.Query_From_Range()
qry_ptr = parentform:Tables:Customer.Index_Primary_Get()
rec_count = qry_ptr.records_get()
ui_msg_box("Records in query","Range has " + str(rec_count) + " records")

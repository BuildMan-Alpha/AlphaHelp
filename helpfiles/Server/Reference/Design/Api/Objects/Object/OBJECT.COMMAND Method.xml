CommandThe command to send to the object.

Example
The following example shows how to use the CONTROLPANEL.COMMAND() method to limit the number of records that a user can save in a demonstration application.
dim t as P
dim new_code as C
dim tables as C
dim i as N
dim count as N
new_code = &lt
t = table.current() 
if (t.recno()> 30) then 
cancel() 
ui_msg_box("Notice","Using an evaluation version. Can't save more than 30 records.") 
end if 
%code% 
tables = a5.Table_Enum() 

count = line_count(tables) 
for i = 1 to count 
StatusBar.percent(i,count) 
table_i = word(tables,i,crlf()) 
table_name = table.name_normalize(table_i) 
xbasic_wait_for_idle() 
controlPanel.SetFocus(table_i,"table") 
xbasic_wait_for_idle() 
ControlPanel.command("fieldrules") 
xbasic_wait_for_idle() 

cmd = "Rule_System:" + table_name + ".code.CanSaveRecord" 
eval(cmd) = new_code 
rule_system.command("FILE_SAVE") 
xbasic_wait_for_idle() 
rule_system.close() 
next i

Syntax
&ltOBJECT>.SHOW_ALL()
Description
The &ltOBJECT>.SHOW_ALL() method applies to:
Where &ltOBJECT>  is a pointer to an open Form or Browse layout..
The &ltOBJECT>.SHOW_ALL() method turns off the current query and shows all records in the table (subject to any base filter that may have been specified).
In the case of Form layouts that have embedded browse objects, or sub-forms, that display records from one-to-many linked child tables, the .SHOW_ALL() method can also be used to show all of the records in a child table, after a filter has been applied to the child table. (See example below) 
Limitations
Desktop applications only.
Example
This script is attached to a button. It turns off the current query.
Parent.show_all()

This script is attached to a button. It turns off the current query that was applied to the records in the embedded browse 'browse1'.
topparent:browse1.show_all()

When you use the .VIEWQUERIED() method to open a Form or Browse and apply a filter, you can specify if the filter that is applied to the target layout is a base filter, or a user filter. If the filter is a user-filter, the .SHOW_ALL() method can be used to remove the filter. However, if the filter is a base filter, the .SHOW_ALL() method cannot be used to remove the base filter.

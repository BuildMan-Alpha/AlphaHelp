Syntax
&ltOBJECT>.REPAINT()
Description
The &ltOBJECT>.REPAINT() method applies to:

 Browses (for &ltOBJECT> use either the &ltBROWSE> pointer or the name of the browse)

 Forms (for &ltOBJECT> use either the &ltFORM> pointer or the name of the form)

 Form Controls (for &ltOBJECT> use the &ltCONTROL> pointer or the address of the control) 
The &ltOBJECT>.REPAINT() method re-displays a control, browse, or form. In some very rare situations, an Alpha Anywhere form may not repaint properly after you perform some action. You can now force objects on the form to repaint. For example, if a browse did not repaint properly after you navigated to a new record, the topparent:browse1.repaint() method would repaint the browse object called browse1.
Limitations
Desktop applications only.
Example
dim ptr as P
dim fld as P
ptr = form.load("Customer Information")
ptr.show()
fld = ptr.Child("Lastname")
fld.text = "Lincoln"
fld.Repaint()

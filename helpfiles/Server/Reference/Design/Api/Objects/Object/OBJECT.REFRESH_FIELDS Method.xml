Syntax
&ltOBJECT>.REFRESH_FIELDS()
Description
The &ltOBJECT>.REFRESH_FIELDS() method applies to:

 Browses (for &ltOBJECT> use either the &ltBROWSE> pointer or the name of the browse)

 Forms (for &ltOBJECT> use either the &ltFORM> pointer or the name of the form) 
The &ltOBJECT>.REFRESH_FIELDS() method executes the .REFRESH() method on each field object on a layout.
Limitations
Desktop applications only.
Example
dim p as P
dim t as P
p = form.view("Customer")
'get a pointer to the primary table in the form
t = p.Table_Get()
'start entering a new record, honoring field rules
t.enter_begin(honor_field_rules)
t.lastname = "Smith"
t.firstname = "Simon"
'at this point, the form does not yet show the new data
p.Refresh_fields()

Now the form shows the new data, but it is still in enter mode. Contrast this method with the <FORM>.RESYNCH() method which refreshes the form by re-displaying the data from the record in the record buffer. This method can only be executed if the form is in View mode.

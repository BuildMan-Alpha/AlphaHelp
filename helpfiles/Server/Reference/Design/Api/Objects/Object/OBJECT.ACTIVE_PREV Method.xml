Syntax
Name_String as C = &ltOBJECT>.ACTIVE_PREV( [ Name_Flag as L ] )
ArgumentDescription
Name_FlagOptional. Default = .F. (FALSE)

 .F. = Returns control name.

 .T. = Returns fully qualified control name. 

Description
The &ltOBJECT>.ACTIVE_PREV() method applies to:

 Browses (for &ltOBJECT> use either the &ltBROWSE> pointer or the name of the browse)

 Forms (for &ltOBJECT> use either the &ltFORM> pointer or the name of the form) 
The &ltOBJECT>.ACTIVE_PREV() method returns the name of the control which previously had focus.
Limitations
Desktop applications only.
Example
This script returns the name of the control on the Sales form that previously had focus.
name = :Sales.Active_prev()

This script (which is attached to a button on a form) returns focus to the object that had focus immediately prior to clicking the button (so that the button code can operate on that object). In this example, the button blanks out the value in the field that had focus by setting its text property to a NULL value.
prev_obj = parentform.Active_prev()
obj_point = obj(prev_obj)
obj_point.activate()
obj_point.text = ""

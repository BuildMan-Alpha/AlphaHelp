   <description>Read bytes from socket into blob.</description>
   <discussion>
The .READ() method reads up to Number_of_Bytes bytes of binary data from a socket. The amount of data returned may be smaller than Number_of_Bytes if there is less than Number_of_Bytes bytes of data to be read. This will happen if the socket has not received at least Number_of_Bytes bytes of data from the remote connection, either because it did not send that much or because it has not yet traversed the network.
If a timeout occurs, .READB()generates an A5SOCKETTIMEOUT error and an ON ERROR GOTO trap can be used to take an appropriate action.

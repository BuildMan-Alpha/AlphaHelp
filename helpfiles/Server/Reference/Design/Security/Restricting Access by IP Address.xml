	<topic>Restricting Access by IP Address</topic>
	<description>The Application Server Control Panel allows you to restrict access by IP address on the Access tab.
This is a server-wide configuration. To implement this at the page level, add some Xbasic to the top of your restricted pages to check the IP address, which is available to you as  REQUEST.REMOTE_ADDR . Something like the following if added to your pages would only allow access by the specified IP address. Anyone else would be redirected to a different page. Limitations</description>

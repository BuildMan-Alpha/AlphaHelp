<description>The page was built by opening the GRD_LOGINDATAGRD_INTUSERLIST Grid Component grid component in the grid builder and selecting "Save Page" from the toolbar. The page was then edited to Romove Non-essential Code. The only sections left on the page were Body.Search_HTML and Body.GRID_HTML, although the search section could also be removed as it isn't used. </description>

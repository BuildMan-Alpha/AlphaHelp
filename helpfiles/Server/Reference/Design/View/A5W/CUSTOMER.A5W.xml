<description>When you look at CUSTOMER.A5W with the Source tab of the HTML Editor, you will see a large amount of HTML and Xbasic code. The HTML Editor placed almost all of it there automatically, as we used the WYSIWYG tab to place the tables, text, graphics, and components on the page. There are a few interesting exceptions, where we changed the page code through the Source tab.
The function a5ws_Logged_in_User_Values() returns values for the current logged in user in a pointer variable, pUser. The userid is passed to the dialog as a request variable where it can be used to find a security record for the user.

<example><![CDATA[' need 'userid' for current user to populate security values if a customer record is not found
dim pUser as p
a5ws_logged_in_user_values(pUser,request,session)
request.variables.userid = pUser.userid
]]></example>

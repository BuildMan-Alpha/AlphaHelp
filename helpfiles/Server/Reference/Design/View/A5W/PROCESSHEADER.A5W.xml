<description>The PROCESSHEADER.A5W page is an ordinary HTML page without Xbasic coding. It only appears in the top section of a frame set.
Since this page contains no Xbasic, we could have saved it as a .HTM file instead of .A5W. If the page were saved as .HTM, the references to the page in the frame sets would have to change. We originally saved the page as .A5W to allow the potential to use Xbasic to add dynamic content.

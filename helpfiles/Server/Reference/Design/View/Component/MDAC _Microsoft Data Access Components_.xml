	<description>To use the ADO Import Genie, you must have ADO available. To have ADO available means you must have MDAC installed.
If you have problems with MDAC, this link takes you to a Microsoft utility named Component Checker that can repair you MDAC installation. From the Microsoft site:
"Component Checker utility has been redesigned to provide XML support. The new tool includes updated snapshots for MDAC 2.7 SP1 on Windows XP SP1 and MDAC 2.8 SP2 on Windows Server 2003 SP1. The Component Checker tool is designed to help you determine installed version information and diagnose installation issues with the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC)."

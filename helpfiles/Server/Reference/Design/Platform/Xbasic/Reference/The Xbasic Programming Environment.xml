	<description>Xbasic is Alpha Anywhere's programming language. You use Xbasic to create scripts. Scripts can be run in several different ways. A Global Script can be run from the Control Panel by simply double clicking on it, or clicking the "Run" button.</description>

		<description>Other scripts are attached to objects and are run automatically when an event takes place. For example, a script might be attached to a button on a form. The script will run when the button is pressed. In this case the script is attached to the button's OnPush event. Or, a script might be attached to a form's "OnSave" event. In this case, the script will be executed whenever a record in the form is saved. See the Field Rule Events and Object Events for more details on the various Alpha Anywhere events.

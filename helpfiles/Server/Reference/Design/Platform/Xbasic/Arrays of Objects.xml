	<description>As of the writing of this help topic, it is impossible to DIM an array of objects based on a class. The following code sample shows a work-around.
This example creates an array containing five SQL::TableInfo objects.

	<example><![CDATA[dim ti as SQL::TableInfo
dim arr[5] as P
arr[1] = ti
for i = 2 to 5
    arr[i] = ti.clone()
next i ]]></example>

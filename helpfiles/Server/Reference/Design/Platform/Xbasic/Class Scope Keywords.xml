				<p>Without a keyword, the scope of the class is Local (just like a local  function). It can only be used in the current script where it is defined.  With a keyword, the scope of the class extends beyond the script in  which it is defined. </p>
				<p>In other words, the scope of a class is much like the scope of a variable.</p>

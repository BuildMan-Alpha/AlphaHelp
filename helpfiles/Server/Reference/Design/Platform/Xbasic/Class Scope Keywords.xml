		<description>Three keywords are available:</description>
		<cases>
			<case>
				<description>Shared - all scripts in the current session.  </description>
			</case>
			<case>
				<description>Global - all scripts in the current Database  </description>
			</case>
			<case>
				<description>System - all scripts until Alpha Anywhere is closed down - so you can  change from one database to another, and your class is still defined.  </description>
			</case>
			
		</cases>

		<description>Without a keyword, the scope of the class is Local (just like a local  function). It can only be used in the current script where it is defined.  With a keyword, the scope of the class extends beyond the script in  which it is defined.  
In other words, the scope of a class is much like the scope of a variable.

		<description>For users who would like to automate, and customize different aspects of their application without having to program in Xbasic, Action Scripting provides an easy to use "font end" to Xbasic. Action Scripting is a graphical method for creating Xbasic scripts. Action Scripting is also an excellent way to learn Xbasic, because for each Action Script that you create, you can examine the underlying Xbasic code. Action Scripting is covered in the Introduction to Action Scripting book.</description>

			<h2>Request Object</h2>
<p>A number of new properties have been added to the Request object. These allow  developers to simplify code while maintaining or adding functionality.</p>
<p><b>Request.Accept</b> - Contains the value of the Accept header included with  the request. If an Accept header was not included in the request, the value will  be blank. Previously, this property would not exist if the header was not  included, requiring additional Xbasic code to test for its existence first.</p>
<p><b>Request.AcceptCharset</b> - Contains the value of the Accept-Charset  header included with the request. If an Accept-Charset header was not included  in the request, the value will be blank. Previously, this property would not  exist if the header was not included, requiring additional Xbasic code to test  for its existence first.</p>
<p><b>Request.AcceptEncoding</b> - Contains the value of the Accept-Encoding  header included with the request. If an Accept-Encoding header was not included  in the request, the value will be blank. Previously, this property would not  exist if the header was not included, requiring additional Xbasic code to test  for its existence first.</p>
<p><b>Request.AcceptLanguage</b> - Contains the value of the Accept-Language  header included with the request. If an Accept-Language header was not included  in the request, the value will be blank. Previously, this property would not  exist if the header was not included, requiring additional Xbasic code to test  for its existence first.</p>
<p><b>Request.ApplicationRootUrl</b> - Contains the URL of the current file relative to the application root.
</p>
<p><b>Request.Cookie</b> - Contains the value of the Cookie header included with  the request. If a Cookie header was not included in the request, the value will  be blank. Previously, this property would not exist if the header was not  included, requiring additional Xbasic code to test for its existence first.</p>
<p><b>Request.IfUnmodifiedSince</b> - Contains the value of the  If-Unmodified-Since header included with the request. If an If-Unmodified-Since  header was not included in the request, the value will be blank. Previously,  this property would not exist if the header was not included, requiring  additional Xbasic code to test for its existence first.</p>
<p><b>Request.UserAgent</b> - Contains the value of the User-Agent header  included with the request. If a User-Agent header was not included in the  request, the value will be blank.

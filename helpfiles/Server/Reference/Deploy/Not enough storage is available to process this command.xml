<description>We have seen several cases where the Alpha Server crashes with the message "Not enough storage is available to process this command" in the error log. This is a Microsoft system-level problem, namely running out of interrupt request stack space, which can be fixed by making a registry change to allocate a larger IRPStackSize.

 This [blog posting] by Ron Gabriel gives step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. It is also discussed in this [Microsoft Support article].</description>

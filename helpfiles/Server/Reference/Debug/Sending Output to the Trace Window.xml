	<description>Send output to the Trace window from either your Xbasic scripts or from the Interactive window</description>
<discussion>The Trace window is an ideal place to send output when you are developing and debugging scripts. You will notice that Alpha Anywhere sends all types of messages and output to this window as it runs. For example, the Trace window is where you find detailed warning and error messages which would otherwise be too long or numerous for display in a dialog box.
To display the Trace window, select View > Trace Window from the main menu.
To send text output to the Trace window from either your Xbasic scripts or from the Interactive window, you use either the TRACE.WRITE() or TRACE.WRITELN() methods. For more information, see the descriptions of these commands.

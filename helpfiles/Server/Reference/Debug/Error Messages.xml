			<title>WSAENOBUFS - No buffer space available while opening socket.</title>
			<description>This is an error message returned by the operating system and it basically means that there are no more sockets available to be used. The Application Server will use one socket for each active connection, up to the maximum defined in the Application Server Control Panel (default is 16). Any other Internet application (web browser, email client, etc) running on your server will also consume sockets.

			<title>Error during Load

"Error running startup_pdf:could not find/load external library"

"Error running addin_startup_save_as drivers not found"
</title>
			<description>These messages indicate that the PDF/RTF/HTML and text printer drivers that come with a5 are not installed. These printer drivers are installed automatically the first time Alpha Anywhere is started. There could be several reasons as to why the printer drivers did not get installed. The most common is that you are logged on to an account that does not have the necessary permission to install printer drivers. If this is the case, use an administrator account the first time you start Alpha Anywhere. Another reason is that you are using Windows Server 2003, in which case there is a special procedure you have to go through to install printer drivers.

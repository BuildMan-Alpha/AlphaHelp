			<description>In Alpha Five Version 11 we install the new Oracle 11g client.</description>
		<note>Note that it is not necessary for your Oracle client to be installed in the Alpha Anywhere program directory. As long as you have a 32-bit Oracle client properly installed on your machine that works with your Oracle database, and the client is in the DOS path, Alpha Anywhere should be able to use it.</note>

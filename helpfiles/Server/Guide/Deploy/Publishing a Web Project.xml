	<description>Publishing one or more files in a project places them in a server directory, so that the Application Server can make them available to users.</description>

			<description>When developing an application, you will publish to your computer's local webroot. You can see pages in this location, but they are not available to anyone else. When an application has been completed, you will publish to a web server. The publishing process is the same in both cases. Only the destinations differ.

	<title>Publishing Multiple Web Sites with Different URLs</title>
	<description>The Application Server does not support virtual hosting. as a result, if you have multiple web sites, they must be located under a single URL.
If your server is located at www.myserver.com and you have your document root set to D:\home\Default, you would publish one site to D:\home\Default\site1 and the second to D:\home\Default\site2. Your two functional URLs would then be http://www.myserver.com/site1/ for site1 and http://www.myserver.com/site2/ for site 2.

		<p>The default folders would be:</p>

		<p style="margin-left:40px;">alpha5.exe - C:\Program Files (x86)\a5V12</p>
		<p style="margin-left:40px;">A5ApplicationServer.exe - C:\Program Files (x86)\a5V12 ApplicationServer</p>

			<li>
				<p>Stop all running instances of any Alpha program. That would include any instance of</p>
				<p>Alpha5.exe, or A5ApplicationServer.exe.You may need to use the Windows Task Manager to confirm.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the <b>[program folder]</b>.</li>
			<li>Create a new sub-folder under the <b>[program folder] </b> called “hotfix”.&nbsp; If the folder already exists, remove
				any existing files in the folder.</li>
			<li>Unzip or copy the hotfix file into this new folder.</li>
			<li>In Windows Explorer find the “A5Hotfix.exe” executable file in the list of files (in the executable). DO NOT double click

				<p>Open the <b>[program folder]</b> and find the file “System.aex”.</p>

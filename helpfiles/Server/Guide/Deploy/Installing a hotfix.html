<h1>Install a hotfix</h1>
<p>Alpha Anywhere has a utility called <b>A5HotFix</b> that patches the System.aex file with hotfix aex files that are installed in the hotfix folder.</p>
<p>The directions to install the hotfix in your build are</p>
<ol>
	<li>Copy the hotfix file into the hotfix folder, this will often be <i>"c:\Program Files (x86)\A5v12\hotfix"</i>.</li>
	<li>Make sure there are no instances of <i>"alpha5.exe"</i> or <i>"A5ApplicationServer.exe"</i> running - you can use task manager to determine this (In windows 10, make sure to go to the Details tab and sort on the 'Name' column).</li>
	<li>Open a command window in Administrator mode (you can do this by right clicking on the command menu item and selected 'Run as Admininstrator')</li>
	<li>Go to the EXE folder (i.e. cd <i>"c:\Program Files (x86)\A5v12"</i>)</li>
	<li>Type A5HotFix, which should provide feedback.</li>
	<li>If there were no problems (i.e. a hotfix generally valid only for a specific range of releases of alpha five) the fix will be installed.</li>
	<li>If you do run into problems do to the installed release being to old, you may not have the latest available build, install the latest prerelease of Alpha Anywhere <b>before</b> applying the hotfix.</li>

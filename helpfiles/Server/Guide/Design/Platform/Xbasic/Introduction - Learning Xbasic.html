<p class=A3Topic>Introduction - Learning Xbasic</p>



<p>Xbasic is Alpha Fives built-in programming language.&nbsp;Out of the
 box, Alpha Anywhere is a powerful database and application development software
 package.&nbsp;You can use Alpha Anywhere for lots of different information
 management needs without doing any programming by using the Alpha Anywhere
 menus, commands, and <span class=Bolded>Genies</span>.</p>




<table class="calloutTable" style="x-cell-content-align: top;
				width: 100%;
				border-spacing: 0px;
				border-spacing: 0px;" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<col style="width: 100%;">

<tr style="x-cell-content-align: top;" valign="top">
<td style="x-cell-content-align: top;
			width: 100%;

<p class=TableLeft><span class=Bolded>Genies</span> are sequences of commands
 that Alpha Anywhere performs to automatically accomplish various tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;After
 you&nbsp;answer a series of questions about what you need to do, Alpha Anywhere figures out the best way to accomplish the task and runs it. For
 example, Alpha Anywhere includes an Import Data Genie that guides you through
 incorporating existing data from external files into an Alpha Anywhere database.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Genies and the Alpha Anywhere commands enable you to do a lot; Programming
 with Xbasic gives you even more control and options.</td></tr>

<p>However, learning Xbasic will provide you with the tools to do much
 more with Alpha Anywhere.&nbsp;Mastering Xbasic will open up vast new opportunities
 for you to create highly customized applications and will allow you to
 manipulate your data in just the way you want.&nbsp;And the new additions
 to the Xbasic commands in Version 5 provide you with the power to design
 and develop applications using the latest Windows techniques, structures,
 and tools.</p>



<p>Xbasic is a very rich programming language with literally hundreds of
 commands, so it is not possible to learn everything you can do with Xbasic
 in this volume.&nbsp;You will get a good grounding in basic programming
 concepts that you should understand in order to use Xbasic efficiently.
 You will want to refer to the Alpha Five Xbasic Reference Guide to explore
 all the different options that Xbasic offers and you should experiment
 with different Xbasic techniques and commands to really learn by doing.
 We think programming is creative and fun and we hope you will too.</p>

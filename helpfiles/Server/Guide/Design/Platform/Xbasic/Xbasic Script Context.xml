			<description>When you run a script that is attached to a toolbar button, the script has the same context as the active window. The aliases this and parentform, used in a script attached to a toolbar button, refers to the active window. For example, assume that you have a toolbar with this Xbasic code attached to one of the buttons on the toolbar:</description>
			<example><![CDATA[name = this.name()
ui_msg_box("window name is:" , name) ]]></example>

			<description>When you press the toolbar button, it will report the name of the window that is active.
The following example shows code that could be attached to a Query By Form toolbar to insert the "Is not blank" search operator into the field that currently has focus:
</description>
			<example><![CDATA['Determine which object currently has focus
active_object = parentform.active()
'Get a pointer to that object
ptr = obj(active_object)
'Set the text property of that object
ptr.text = "Is not blank" ]]></example>

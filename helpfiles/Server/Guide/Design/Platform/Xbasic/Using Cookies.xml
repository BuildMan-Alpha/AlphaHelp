			<title>Writing a Cookie</title>
			<description>Web publishing applications only. When you need to save a value between sessions you can save it in a cookie. To save a cookie use the RESPONSE.ADD_COOKIE() method.
This example creates a cookie named "Application" which holds the value "Alpha Five" and will stay on the client for 2592000 seconds (6 months).

			<example><![CDATA[response.add_cookie("Application", "Alpha Five", 2592000)
]]></example>

	<title>Reading a Cookie</title>
	<description>Your browser will make all un-expired cookies sent by your server available to you. A cookie's value is available directly as a variable in your page. The previous example created a cookie named username. On all subsequent pages, you can reference the variable username (or test for its existence with eval_valid(username) ).

The cookie variable is essentially read-only in your page. To modify the value stored by the browser, you would need to use another RESPONSE.ADD_COOKIE()call.
request.cookies Contains a list of all un-expired cookies.

			<h2>Check the logs</h2>
<p>The Application Server can record a variety of useful information in  different log files. The value of these log files in detecting and  troubleshooting any problems is immeasurable. Many times, application users will  not report what they presume to be minor errors, or they may not even be aware  of something like a missing image which, if present, would enhance the usability  or appearance of the application.</p>
<p>The primary server log is the Access log. This file contains an entry for  every resource that was requested and, along with other information, an <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">HTTP status  code</a> to indicate the result of the request. A regular review of the Access  log with reveal any recurring problems, such as missing files (status code 404)  or pages that generally generate errors (typically status code 500).</p>
<p>The Error log also records each error, and usually contains some more  specific information on what the problem was. For example, the Access log may  record that a specific request resulted in a 500 status, while the corresponding  entry in the Error log may reveal that it was an Xbasic error, with the specific  error text and line number.</p>
<p>The Xbasic Error Stack log records the execution stack any time an Xbasic  error occurs. This means that it will not record anything for a non-Xbasic error  such as if a file is not found. When there is an Xbasic error, additional  information about the execution state of your code will be logged. During normal  operation this log will have nothing to record, so it is recommended that this  log be left enabled in order to capture as much debugging information as  possible in the event an error does occur.</p>
<p>The Raw HTTP Traffic log records the raw data sent on the connection between  the server and the client. The information in this log can be used to verify  that the server is receiving a complete request as expected and sending a proper  response to the client. This generally results in a large amount of data being  logged very quickly, and it potentially saves sensitive data in an unencrypted  format, so it is best not to enable this log unless a specific error condition  is being debugged.</p>

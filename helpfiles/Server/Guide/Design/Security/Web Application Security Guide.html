<h3>Web Security Configuration </h3>
	
	<h4 align="left">Security Policy</h4>
<h4 align="center"><br>
<img border="0" src="images/A_Security_Policy_Page.png" width="716" height="502"></h4>
	<p><u><i>Security active<b> </b></i></u>- If security is not activated, all objects and actions will be available to all users without restriction. 
	If security is active, the security system is based on membership in a group.
	
	</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Password Required</i></u> - Select to require a password as well as a User ID for login. A User ID is always required if security is active. 
If you check this box you can set password options under the 'User Id and 
Password Options' tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Redirect page</i></u> - login. This is the name of the page to go to if login is required to access a selected page. This would normally be the login page, or a menu or index page. 
If you do not have a page designated you can type one in here</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Redirect page</i> - <i>insufficient permission</i></u>. If a logged in 
user does not have permission to access a selected page they will be redirected 
to this page. If this page is not specified, they will be redirected to the page 
specified for login.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Use Active Directory</i></u> - Select this option if you want to use 
Active Directory for security data on your production server. See &quot;Using Active 
Directory&quot; link at the bottom of the dialog for more information. </p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Checking the 
User Active Directory will change the 'Security Table Type' setting to 'Security 
Table Type for Development and Testing'. Checking this box will also remove the 
'Data Recovery Options' tab from the top of the Security Settings dialog box. It 
will truncate the setting options that are available under 'User Id and Password 
Options' tab and the 'Customize Options' tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Security Table Type for Development and Testing</i></u> - Select the 
data type for storing the web security data that will be used during development 
and testing of the application. The production deployment of the application 
will use Active Directory for user authentication and authorization. If the type 
is changed from 'DBF Files' to 'SQL Database', a genie will open when the 
security settings are saved to set the connection to the SQL database and define 
the tables to construct.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_Web_Secuity_Data_DBF_SQL.png" width="556" height="387"></p>
<p align="center">Selecting Data Type for Storing Security Data</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;If the type is changed from 'SQL database to 'DBF Files', 
a prompt will display on save to confirm the conversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Security Table Type</i></u> - As long as the 'Use Active Directory' 
Setting is not checked this option will remain open. Select the data for storing 
the web security data. If the type is changed from 'DBF Files' to 'SQL 
Database', a genie will open when the security settings are saved to set the 
connection to the SQL database and define the tables construct. If the type is 
changed from 'SQL database' to 'DBF Files', a prompt will display on save to 
confirm the conversion.
	
	</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Allow Alternative Login</i> </u>- The 'Use Active Directory' Setting 
must be unchecked to see this option. Allow alternative login bascially allows 
the use of an alternative login method to authenticate and login the user; such 
as Google. If you click the check box next to this option two more settings 
appear below it.
	
	</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<i>Automatically Add Authenticated User to Security</i> - 
An authenticated user can automatically be added to the system if they do not 
already have a security record. In the case where the user's identifier from the 
external authentication system does not meet the userId configuration 
requirements in the security system, a unique user id will be generated using 
the user identifier. If the user information is accepted, they will be logged 
into the system when the information is saved.&nbsp;
	
	</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<i>After login Event</i> - The ''afterLogin' event fires 
after a user has successfully been logged in using an external authentication 
method. This event includes variables available after login.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	
	
	
	<h4>Login Options</h4>


<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_Login_Options_Page.png" width="720" height="532"></p>
<p><u><i>Login expiration policy</i></u> - Policy to set the maximum login time 
period. All options other than 'Expires when current session expires' require 
the use of a cookie. If the user does not have cookies enabled, they will be 
logged out when the session expires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Lockout after failed attempts</i> </u>- The number of times a user can 
try to login unsuccessfully before they are locked out of the application. Set 
to 0 to allow unlimited attempts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Locked out action</i></u> - The action that should be taken if a user 
is locked out of the system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'Wait for period of time' will require the user to wait a 
specified time until they are allowed to login with the same User ID. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'Redirect to another page' Will send them to another 
page. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'Lockout user until reset by administrator' will lock out 
the User ID until lock is manually released. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Locked out message</i></u> - Message to show the user during login to 
indicate they are locked out of the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Locked out wait Time</i></u> - Click on the box with three dots to the 
right and the Expiration Time dialog box will load. This allows you to set the 
locked out wait time.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_Expiration%20time.png" width="244" height="212"></p>

<p><u><i>Login activity file</i></u> - When enabled this will save all login 
activity to a text file in the specified folder. If you click the checkbox, 
three option will appear below the login activity file in the list. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'<i>Login activity log to save to</i>' - Folder where 
activity log file will be saved. Select 'User defined function' to enter your 
own code to process log activity data.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;The 'Data folder option' does... and the 'Project 
Target Folder' does...</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'<i>Login activity include failed</i>' - When enabled, 
all failed attempts to log in will be recorded in the login activity log. If not 
checked, only successful logins are recorded in the log file.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<i>'Login activity include logout</i>' - When enabled, 
any user logged out by the 'a5ws_logoutuser()' function will be recorded in the 
login activity log. No log entry will be created if no one is logged on when the 

log out function is called. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><i>Login redirect option</i></u> - Note: Login redirect only applies when 
a login component is used for login. This determines the action to take after a 
successful login. Select,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<i>Current page</i>' if the user should stay on the page 
containing the login component. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<i>Same page'</i> for all logins' to send all users the 
same page after login. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<i>Page assigned by user profile</i>' to allow setting a 
specific page in the user profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><i>Redirect page after login (when using login component)</i></u> - This 
is the name of the page to go to after a successful login. If the redirect 
option is 'Page assigned by user', this page will be used if a redirect page is 
not assigned in the current user profile.</p>
<p>Note: Login redirect only applies when a login component is used for login 
(as opposed to a Tabbed UI or UX component with integrated Login).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><i>Ignore return to page after login</i></u> - When a person attempts to 
open a page or component for which they do not have permission, they are 
redirected to the login page. The default action is to always redirect to the 
page specified by the 'Login redirect option' and the 'Redirect page after login 
(when using login component)'. Uncheck this to return to the previous page.
<font color="#FF0000">This option is automatically checked if component </font>
</p>

<p>Note: Login redirect only applies when a login component is used for login 
(as opposed to a Tabbed UI or UX component with integrated Login).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


	<h4>User Id and Password Options</h4>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_UserID_Password_Options.png" width="736" height="528"></p>


<p><u><i>Overview</i></u> - 'The User Id and Password Options' tab presents you 
with a list of optional settings for both of these topics. To make the Password 
Option Settings visible it check the 'Password required' box under the 'Security 
Policy' in the Security Settings dialog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h5>User ID Options</h5>


<p><u><i>User ID configuration</i></u> - A user id can be configured to allow an 
email address or a field value that meets specified validation rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>User ID error message</i></u> - This option is present when 'Email 
Address' is selected on the drop down list in the 'User ID configuration row 
above it. By default it is set to read 'Not a valid E-mail address' but you can 
customize the error message to you liking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><i>User ID validation rules</i></u> - This setting appears when the User 
ID configuration is set to Value. You can use it to specify rules to test if the value 
for a user id is in fact valid. Click the box to the right and the User ID 
Validation dialog will appear. This allows you to set a specific value to be 
tested and to write a customized error message for cases in which the value of 
the user id is not valid.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_User_ID_Validation_Rules.png" width="473" height="543"></p>

<h5>Password Options</h5>

<p><u><i>Password encryption</i></u> - Allows password data to be encrypted 
prior to saving in the user table. If you check this box a setting for a 
'Password encryption key' setting and a 'Password use legacy encryption' setting 
will appear below it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Password encryption key</i></u> - This option only appears once the 
'Password encryption' box above it is checked. Enter the key to use to encrypt 
all passwords. A key is required if encryption is selected. The key must be a 
minimum of 8 characters in length and a maximum of 64 characters in length. The 
key can use characters, numbers, and special characters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><u>Password use legacy encryption</u> </i>- Select to use the legacy 
encryption used by Alpha Five versions before Alpha Anywhere for new passwords</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Allow password change at login</i></u> - Allows the user to change 
their password at login when using the login component.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> This option is only used by the login component.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Password validation rules</i></u> - Specify rules to test if the value 
for the password is valid.&nbsp; Click the button to the right to edit rules and 
a dialog entitled 'Password Validation' will appear.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_Validation_Rules.png" width="479" height="546"></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">How do you use this dialog?</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Password expires?</i></u> - Allows setting an expiration time for a 
password. A new password must be entered when the current password expires. If 
you check this box a setting for a 'Password expiration time' option will appear 
below it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Password expiration time</i></u>. The period of time a password will be 
active before it automatically expires. The expiration is re-calculated when a 
new password is entered. The default expiration time is one year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Password restricted re-use - The number of old passwords that are saved in a 
restricted list and can not be re-used. A value of 0 will allow any password to 
be re-used without restriction. A value of 1 will only require that a new 
password does not match the current password.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Data Recovery Options</h4>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_Data_Recovery.png" width="724" height="539"></p>
<p>Overview - The 'Data Recovery Options' tab appears as long as the 'Use Active Directory' 
box under the 'Security Policy' tab on the Security Settings dialog is not 
checked. Generally speaking this option is not recommended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Allow user ID recovery</i></u> - Allow the user to recover their User 
ID if they have lost it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Data required for recovery </i></u>- The information that must be 
entered to identify the user to recover the User ID. From the drop down you can 
select either a 'Valid Email Address' or a 'Valid Email Address &amp; Security 
Question'. If you select the latter of the two, a setting for 'Security 
questions will appear at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Lost password action</i></u> - Allow the user to recover or reset a 
lost password. If 'reset' is selected, the system will automatically generate a 
new random password that meets the password validation rules. Normally the drop 
down next to 'Lost password action' is set to 'Not Allowed'. If you select 
'Reset password' or 'Recover password' from the drop down the 'Data required for 
password reset or recovery' option should open underneath the 'Lost password 
action' option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Data required for password reset or recovery</i></u> - This option 
appears if 'Recover Password' or 'Reset&nbsp; Password' are selected in the 
'Lost password action' drop down list. The data required for password reset or 
recovery is the information that must be entered to identify the user to recover 
or reset the password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Lost data recovery method</i></u> - This is the method that is used to 
recover a lost id or password. There are three options in the drop down list to 
the right, 'Send Email to user', 'Create Email link on page', and 'Show on 
Screen'</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>If 'Send Email to user' is selected five additional option settings will 
	open below it in the Lost Data Recovery Options list. These include a 'Lost 
	data recovery alternative method', an 'Email profile for sending emails' 
	option, a 'Send user ID with password?' option, a 'Configure email to send 
	to user with user ID option, and a 'Configure email to send to user with 
	password' option. If 'Send email to user'&nbsp; is selected and there is no 
	Host computer configured to send Email, the alternative method will be used.
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>'Create Email link on page' will show an email link on the page that will 
	allow the user to send a pre-configured email request for lost data to a 
	defined address. It will also open a 'Configure email request from user' 
	option underneath it. that will create an email request from the user.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font color="#FF0000">'Show on Screen'</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u><i>Lost data recovery alternative method</i></u> - This is the method that 
will be used to recover a lost user id or password if 'Send Email to user' is 
selected and the Host computer is not configured to send email. If you select 
'Create Email link on page' in the drop down list to the right a 'Configure 
email request from user' option will appear. In short, this will allow the user 
to send a pre-configured email request for lost data to a defined address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Email profile for sending emails</i></u> - Enter the name of an email 
profile that is configured on the application server in the published location. 
If no profile is specified, the send email process will attempt to use the 
current active email profile on the server. If the profile specified is invalid 
or not found on the server, the alternate recovery method will be used. This 
option appears if the 'Lost data recovery method' is set to 'Send Email to 
user'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Send user ID with password?</i></u> - Should the lost data recovery 
Email being sent to the user include both their User ID and their Password in 
the same message? If not selected, 2 emails will be sent if the recovery process 
was used to find their User ID. If checked, the 'Configure email to send to user 
with user ID' setting, directly below this option, will change to 'Configure 
email to send to user'. The 'Send user ID with password?' option should show up 
when the 'Lost data recovery method' is set to 'Send Email to user'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Configure email to send to user with user ID</i></u> - This is the 
Email configuration to create an email to send to the listed Email address for 
the user. The Host computer MUST be configured to send email. The email will 
only contain the User ID and will be used if the user is requesting a lost User 
ID. This option appears if the 'Lost data recovery method' is set to 'Send Email 
to user' and the Send user ID with password? box is not selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Configure email to send to user with password</i></u> - This is the 
Email configuration to create an email to send to the listed Email address for 
the user. The Host computer MUST be configured to send email. The email will 
only contain the password and will be used only if the user is requesting a lost 
password. The 'Configure email to send to user with password' option appears if 
the 'Lost data recovery method' is set to 'Send Email to user'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Configure email request from user</i></u> - This option will appear 
when the 'Lost data recovery method' is set to 'Create Email link on page' or, 
alternatively, when the 'Lost data recovery method' is set to 'Send Email to 
user' and the 'Lost data recovery alternative method' is set to 'Create Email 
link on page'. </p>

<p align="center">The configure email request from user dialog</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Security questions</i></u> - The information that must be entered to 
identify the user to recover the User ID. You must set the 'Data required for 
recovery' option to 'Valid Email Address &amp; Security Question' before the 
security question option will appear. If you click the button to the right of 
the option the Login Recovery Security Questions dialog will open. This dialog 
lets you select from a number of existing security questions and also gives you 
the option of creating your own questions.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_Customize_Options.png" width="731" height="543"></p>
<p align="center">The Customize Options Tab</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Default security group</i></u> - This option will allow setting a 
default&nbsp; security group or groups for a new user record. This default value 
would only be used for a new user if no groups were included in the data 
submitted for the new user. The default group will only be added to new users 
added by running on the application server. <font color="#FF0000">How to 
activate security ?</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Enable external user identifier field</i></u>. This option will enable 
a special field named 'ulink'. The value entered in the 'ulink' can identify a 
related user record in the external table. While available this option is not 
recommended. The security 'userid' should be stored in an external table if 
linking is required. User records may also exist in tables outside the security 
system. Checking the box to the right of this option will reveal two more 
options , one for a 'Session variable for user identifier field' and a second 
one titled 'Prompt to display for identifier field'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Session variable for user identifier field</i></u> - An optional 
setting, this allows you to enter the name of a session variable to contain the 
value from the 'ulink' field. If the security framework is on, the session 
variable will always exist for every page. The variable value will be blank if 
no one is logged on, or contain a 'ulink' value from the logged in user record, 
if a value exist for that user. This option appears when the 'Enable external 
user identifier field' option in checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Prompt to display for identifier field</i></u> - Enter the prompt to 
display on the Users and Groups from the 'ulink' field. The text can describe 
the source of the value. This option appears when the 'Enable external user 
identifier field' option in checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>User verification field values required</i></u> - You have enabled the 
feature that allows a user to recover lost login information. This option will 
determine if values in the User Verification Fields MUST be entered, or if they 
are OPTIONAL. <b>Note:</b> This option is only available when using the login 
component.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_User_Verification_Fields.png" width="765" height="494"></p>
<p><u><i>User recovery email invalid message</i></u> - The message to show if 
the email entered to identify a user for data recovery is not a valid email 
address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>User ID not unique error message</i></u> - Used ID values must be 
unique. This Message will display if the User ID entered already exists in the 
user table. This message is only used in a web component. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>User file - required data missing message</i></u> - This message is 
displayed if required data is missing when saving a new or changing a user 
record. This message is&nbsp; only used in a web component.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Password - confirm password doesn't match message</i></u> - This 
message is only displayed if the optional 'confirm_password' value doesn't match 
the entered password. This message is only used in a web component. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Enable component security for 'virtual pages'</i></u> - Some Ajax 
actions open grids and reports on virtual pages. The default security for 
virtual pages is 'Always Allowed'. Select this option to enable security at the 
component level. When selected, components and reports on virtual pages are 
'Always Denied' by default and must be have permissions set. Grids on pages use 
the page permission. If this option is checked an 'Enforce security at the 
component level for AJAX components' option appears below it in the 'Customize 
Options' list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Enforce security at the component level for AJAX components</i></u> - 
AJAX enabled components on pages use the page permission. Checking this option 
will force all Ajax actions to use the component security permissions defined in 
the Web Security instead of the page permission. All components opened by 
Javascript or by virtual pages always use the component security permissions if 
component security is enabled. This option appears if the Enable component 
security for 'virtual pages'<u> </u>option is checked. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Ask browser to not cache requests requiring login</i></u> - Check this 
option to ask a browser to turn off caching for any item that requires login. 
This ONLY applies to requests for items that require login to view. This will 
normally cause the browser to make a new request for a page if the browser 
'back' or 'forward' buttons are used. Caching will still be permitted if 
security is off, or the page or component requested is always allowed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Cache lifetime (in seconds)</i></u> - The security settings are cached 
on the server for improved speed and are not automatically updated when the new 
settings are published. The cache lifetime (in seconds) determines how often the 
server will check for updates. A value of 300 will allow the server to check for 
new published settings every 5 minutes. Set the value to 0 to never check for 
updates.</p>

 <a name="Overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Web Security Framework easily adds a sophisticated security system to any
web application running on the Alpha Anywhere Application Server. The security system is integrated into the server operation. 
When the security framework is turned on, the server automatically checks 
every requested page or file for proper security clearance from information 
saved in memory. The server checks the page or file permission and will 
return the requested file if it is permitted within the security framework 
for the project containing the file. If the page or file is not allowed, 
the server automatically checks the security configuration to determine 
the proper response. This process is repeated for every page and file 
request, including images, CSS style sheets, and JavaScript files. If a field on 
a component is not available to the user, the Application Server will remove it from the component on the page returned to the 
user. If a menu entry is not available to the user, its link will be disabled. 
The following picture shows how the security framework categorizes pages, 
controls on grid and dialog components, and menu entries. Any page can be in one 
of three categories:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>-no access permitted</p>
	<p>-access without login</p>
	<p>-access after login and 
appropriate group membership.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Access to menu entries and controls (on any page that requires login) 
can further require appropriate group membership. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of easy to use dialogs available to configure the security 
for a project When a project is initially created there are no security files. 
The top menu on the Web Projects Control Panel has a Web Security Button. Open 
the Security Settings dialog, where various security options can be assigned. You must have at least one page 
defined in the project to build the security settings. The other menu options 
are disabled until these security settings have been defined. The Security Settings dialog has many options to configure the web security 
or turn it off completely. Some of these options include requiring a password, 
configuring user ID and password validations, determining how to respond to an 
incorrect login, allowing the user to change their password, user id and 
password recovery, and many other options. </p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have defined all desired security parameters, you may build a login 
component. After you build the login, you may add it to a page.&nbsp;As&nbsp;with other 
components, parameter overrides on the page may modify the component's messages 
and style sheet(s). All of the code to validate the user and respond to the 
login actions is included within the component. The developer does not have to 
add any code to any page to implement security. Since the login page may not 
have existed prior to setting the initial security parameters, reopen the 
Security Settings dialog and add the login page name to the redirect options 
desired. You can open the Users and Groups dialog to define the users and groups. The 
fields shown when entering or editing users are determined by the security 
parameters selected. Not all possible fields may be shown. The security system 
includes an option to activate a special field named 'ulink'. The value entered 
in the 'ulink' field can identify a related user record in an external table. 
There are options on the dialog to import user information from existing tables 
or export security data to an external table. The users, groups, and permissions 
tables are defined and controlled by the security system. 
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next dialog in the security system is the Page Security dialog The Page 
Security option on the Web Security Menu dialog to open the Page Security 
dialog. This genie assigns permissions for all pages within the project. Pages 
may be always allowed or require a login. If any page requires a login, you must 
assign one of more groups to it. Some pages may not have any assess defined. The 
server will automatically deny or allow these pages, based on the project's 
security configuration. After configuring the page assignments, you may publish 
the page security file from the menu or from the Web Projects Control Panel.
&nbsp;After you have defined and published the Security Settings, Login component, 
Users and Groups, and Page Security, the security system is ready to go. The 
server that contains the published files will automatically check all page and 
file requests for proper security clearance. If you make a change is made to any 
configuration parameter and republish the security files, the next page request 
will automatically use the&nbsp; new settings.

	<a name="Security Policy"></a><h4 align="left">Security Policy</h4>
<h4 align="center"><br>
<img border="0" src="images/A_Security_Policy_Page.png" width="716" height="502"></h4>
	<p><u><i>Security active<b> </b></i></u>- If security is not activated, all objects and actions will be available to all users without restriction. 
	If security is active, the security system is based on membership in a group.
	
	</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Password Required</i></u> - Select to require a password as well as a User ID for login. A User ID is always required if security is active. 
If you check this box you can set password options under the 'User Id and 
Password Options' tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Redirect page</i></u> - login. This is the name of the page to go to if login is required to access a selected page. This would normally be the login page, or a menu or index page. 
If you do not have a page designated you can type one in here</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Redirect page</i> - <i>insufficient permission</i></u>. If a logged in 
user does not have permission to access a selected page they will be redirected 
to this page. If this page is not specified, they will be redirected to the page 
specified for login.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Use Active Directory</i></u> - Select this option if you want to use 
Active Directory for security data on your production server. See &quot;Using Active 
Directory&quot; link at the bottom of the dialog for more information. </p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Checking the 
User Active Directory will change the 'Security Table Type' setting to 'Security 
Table Type for Development and Testing'. Checking this box will also remove the 
'Data Recovery Options' tab from the top of the Security Settings dialog box. It 
will truncate the setting options that are available under 'User Id and Password 
Options' tab and the 'Customize Options' tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Security Table Type for Development and Testing</i></u> - Select the 
data type for storing the web security data that will be used during development 
and testing of the application. The production deployment of the application 
will use Active Directory for user authentication and authorization. If the type 
is changed from 'DBF Files' to 'SQL Database', a genie will open when the 
security settings are saved to set the connection to the SQL database and define 
the tables to construct.</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="left">&nbsp;If the type is changed from 'SQL database to 'DBF Files', 
a prompt will display on save to confirm the conversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Security Table Type</i></u> - As long as the 'Use Active Directory' 
Setting is not checked this option will remain open. Select the data for storing 
the web security data. If the type is changed from 'DBF Files' to 'SQL 
Database', a genie will open when the security settings are saved to set the 
connection to the SQL database and define the tables construct. If the type is 
changed from 'SQL database' to 'DBF Files', a prompt will display on save to 
confirm the conversion.
	
	</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Allow Alternative Login</i> </u>- The 'Use Active Directory' Setting 
must be unchecked to see this option. Allow alternative login bascially allows 
the use of an alternative login method to authenticate and login the user; such 
as Google. If you click the check box next to this option two more settings 
appear below it.
	
	</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<i>Automatically Add Authenticated User to Security</i> - 
An authenticated user can automatically be added to the system if they do not 
already have a security record. In the case where the user's identifier from the 
external authentication system does not meet the userId configuration 
requirements in the security system, a unique user id will be generated using 
the user identifier. If the user information is accepted, they will be logged 
into the system when the information is saved.&nbsp;
	
	</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<i>After login Event</i> - The ''afterLogin' event fires 
after a user has successfully been logged in using an external authentication 
method. This event includes variables available after login.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	
	
	
<a name="Login Options"></a>	<h4>Login Options</h4>

<img border="0" src="images/A_Login_Options_Page.png" width="720" height="532"></p>
<p><u><i>Login expiration policy</i></u> - Policy to set the maximum login time 
period. All options other than 'Expires when current session expires' require 
the use of a cookie. If the user does not have cookies enabled, they will be 
logged out when the session expires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Lockout after failed attempts</i> </u>- The number of times a user can 
try to login unsuccessfully before they are locked out of the application. Set 
to 0 to allow unlimited attempts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Locked out action</i></u> - The action that should be taken if a user 
is locked out of the system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'Wait for period of time' will require the user to wait a 
specified time until they are allowed to login with the same User ID. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'Redirect to another page' Will send them to another 
page. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'Lockout user until reset by administrator' will lock out 
the User ID until lock is manually released. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Locked out message</i></u> - Message to show the user during login to 
indicate they are locked out of the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Locked out wait Time</i></u> - Click on the box with three dots to the 
right and the Expiration Time dialog box will load. This allows you to set the 
locked out wait time.</p>
<p align="center">

<p><u><i>Login activity file</i></u> - When enabled this will save all login 
activity to a text file in the specified folder. If you click the checkbox, 
three option will appear below the login activity file in the list. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'<i>Login activity log to save to</i>' - Folder where 
activity log file will be saved. Select 'User defined function' to enter your 
own code to process log activity data.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;The 'Data folder option' does... and the 'Project 
Target Folder' does...</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'<i>Login activity include failed</i>' - When enabled, 
all failed attempts to log in will be recorded in the login activity log. If not 
checked, only successful logins are recorded in the log file.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<i>'Login activity include logout</i>' - When enabled, 
any user logged out by the 'a5ws_logoutuser()' function will be recorded in the 
login activity log. No log entry will be created if no one is logged on when the 

log out function is called. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><i>Login redirect option</i></u> - Note: Login redirect only applies when 
a login component is used for login. This determines the action to take after a 
successful login. Select,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<i>Current page</i>' if the user should stay on the page 
containing the login component. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<i>Same page'</i> for all logins' to send all users the 
same page after login. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<i>Page assigned by user profile</i>' to allow setting a 
specific page in the user profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><i>Redirect page after login (when using login component)</i></u> - This 
is the name of the page to go to after a successful login. If the redirect 
option is 'Page assigned by user', this page will be used if a redirect page is 
not assigned in the current user profile.</p>
<p>Note: Login redirect only applies when a login component is used for login 
(as opposed to a Tabbed UI or UX component with integrated Login).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><i>Ignore return to page after login</i></u> - When a person attempts to 
open a page or component for which they do not have permission, they are 
redirected to the login page. The default action is to always redirect to the 
page specified by the 'Login redirect option' and the 'Redirect page after login 
(when using login component)'. Uncheck this to return to the previous page.
<font color="#FF0000">This option is automatically checked if component </font>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_UserID_Password_Options.png" width="736" height="528"></p>


<p><u><i>Overview</i></u> - 'The User Id and Password Options' tab presents you 
with a list of optional settings for both of these topics. To make the Password 
Option Settings visible it check the 'Password required' box under the 'Security 
Policy' in the Security Settings dialog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<a name="User ID Options"></a><h5>User ID Options</h5>


<p><u><i>User ID configuration</i></u> - A user id can be configured to allow an 
email address or a field value that meets specified validation rules. Whichever 
of these is selected will determine which option appears below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>User ID error message</i></u> - This option is present when 'Email 
Address' is selected on the drop down list in the 'User ID configuration row 
above it. By default it is set to read 'Not a valid E-mail address' but you can 
customize the error message to you liking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><i>User ID validation rules</i></u> - This setting appears when the User 
ID configuration is set to Value. You can use it to specify rules to test if the value 
for a user id is in fact valid. Click the box to the right and the User ID 
Validation dialog will appear. This allows you to set a specific value to be 
tested and to write a customized error message for cases in which the value of 
the user id is not valid.</p>

password does not match the current password.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<a name="Data Recovery Options"></a><h4>Data Recovery Options</h4>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_Data_Recovery.png" width="724" height="539"></p>
<p><u><i>Overview</i></u> - The 'Data Recovery Options' tab appears as long as the 'Use Active Directory' 
box under the 'Security Policy' tab on the Security Settings dialog is not 
checked. Generally speaking this option is not recommended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Allow user ID recovery</i></u> - Allow the user to recover their User 
ID if they have lost it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Data required for recovery </i></u>- The information that must be 
entered to identify the user to recover the User ID. From the drop down you can 
select either a 'Valid Email Address' or a 'Valid Email Address &amp; Security 
Question'. If you select the latter of the two, a setting for 'Security 
questions will appear at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Lost password action</i></u> - Allow the user to recover or reset a 
lost password. If 'reset' is selected, the system will automatically generate a 
new random password that meets the password validation rules. Normally the drop 
down next to 'Lost password action' is set to 'Not Allowed'. If you select 
'Reset password' or 'Recover password' from the drop down the 'Data required for 
password reset or recovery' option should open underneath the 'Lost password 
action' option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Data required for password reset or recovery</i></u> - This option 
appears if 'Recover Password' or 'Reset&nbsp; Password' are selected in the 
'Lost password action' drop down list. The data required for password reset or 
recovery is the information that must be entered to identify the user to recover 
or reset the password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Lost data recovery method</i></u> - This is the method that is used to 
recover a lost id or password. There are three options in the drop down list to 
the right, 'Send Email to user', 'Create Email link on page', and 'Show on 
Screen'</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>If 'Send Email to user' is selected five additional option settings will 
	open below it in the Lost Data Recovery Options list. These include a 'Lost 
	data recovery alternative method', an 'Email profile for sending emails' 
	option, a 'Send user ID with password?' option, a 'Configure email to send 
	to user with user ID option, and a 'Configure email to send to user with 
	password' option. If 'Send email to user'&nbsp; is selected and there is no 
	Host computer configured to send Email, the alternative method will be used.
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>'Create Email link on page' will show an email link on the page that will 
	allow the user to send a pre-configured email request for lost data to a 
	defined address. It will also open a 'Configure email request from user' 
	option underneath it. that will create an email request from the user.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font color="#FF0000">'Show on Screen'</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u><i>Lost data recovery alternative method</i></u> - This is the method that 
will be used to recover a lost user id or password if 'Send Email to user' is 
selected and the Host computer is not configured to send email. If you select 
'Create Email link on page' in the drop down list to the right a 'Configure 
email request from user' option will appear. In short, this will allow the user 
to send a pre-configured email request for lost data to a defined address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Email profile for sending emails</i></u> - Enter the name of an email 
profile that is configured on the application server in the published location. 
If no profile is specified, the send email process will attempt to use the 
current active email profile on the server. If the profile specified is invalid 
or not found on the server, the alternate recovery method will be used. This 
option appears if the 'Lost data recovery method' is set to 'Send Email to 
user'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Send user ID with password?</i></u> - Should the lost data recovery 
Email being sent to the user include both their User ID and their Password in 
the same message? If not selected, 2 emails will be sent if the recovery process 
was used to find their User ID. If checked, the 'Configure email to send to user 
with user ID' setting, directly below this option, will change to 'Configure 
email to send to user'. The 'Send user ID with password?' option should show up 
when the 'Lost data recovery method' is set to 'Send Email to user'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Configure email to send to user with user ID</i></u> - This is the 
Email configuration to create an email to send to the listed Email address for

only contain the User ID and will be used if the user is requesting a lost User 
ID. This option appears if the 'Lost data recovery method' is set to 'Send Email 
to user' and the Send user ID with password? box is not selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Configure email to send to user with password</i></u> - This is the 
Email configuration to create an email to send to the listed Email address for 
the user. The Host computer MUST be configured to send email. The email will 
only contain the password and will be used only if the user is requesting a lost 
password. The 'Configure email to send to user with password' option appears if 
the 'Lost data recovery method' is set to 'Send Email to user'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Configure email request from user</i></u> - This option will appear 
when the 'Lost data recovery method' is set to 'Create Email link on page' or, 
alternatively, when the 'Lost data recovery method' is set to 'Send Email to 
user' and the 'Lost data recovery alternative method' is set to 'Create Email

submitted for the new user. The default group will only be added to new users 
added by running on the application server. <font color="#FF0000">How to

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Enable external user identifier field</i></u>. This option will enable 
a special field named 'ulink'. The value entered in the 'ulink' can identify a 
related user record in the external table. While available this option is not 
recommended. The security 'userid' should be stored in an external table if 
linking is required. User records may also exist in tables outside the security 
system. Checking the box to the right of this option will reveal two more 
options , one for a 'Session variable for user identifier field' and a second 
one titled 'Prompt to display for identifier field'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Session variable for user identifier field</i></u> - An optional 
setting, this allows you to enter the name of a session variable to contain the 
value from the 'ulink' field. If the security framework is on, the session 
variable will always exist for every page. The variable value will be blank if 
no one is logged on, or contain a 'ulink' value from the logged in user record, 
if a value exist for that user. This option appears when the 'Enable external 
user identifier field' option in checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Prompt to display for identifier field</i></u> - Enter the prompt to 
display on the Users and Groups from the 'ulink' field. The text can describe 
the source of the value. This option appears when the 'Enable external user 
identifier field' option in checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>User verification field values required</i></u> - You have enabled the 
feature that allows a user to recover lost login information. This option will 
determine if values in the User Verification Fields MUST be entered, or if they 
are OPTIONAL. <b>Note:</b> This option is only available when using the login 
component.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_User_Verification_Fields.png" width="765" height="494"></p>
<p><u><i>User recovery email invalid message</i></u> - The message to show if 
the email entered to identify a user for data recovery is not a valid email 
address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>User ID not unique error message</i></u> - Used ID values must be 
unique. This Message will display if the User ID entered already exists in the 
user table. This message is only used in a web component. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>User file - required data missing message</i></u> - This message is 
displayed if required data is missing when saving a new or changing a user 
record. This message is&nbsp; only used in a web component.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Password - confirm password doesn't match message</i></u> - This 
message is only displayed if the optional 'confirm_password' value doesn't match 
the entered password. This message is only used in a web component. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Enable component security for 'virtual pages'</i></u> - Some Ajax 
actions open grids and reports on virtual pages. The default security for 
virtual pages is 'Always Allowed'. Select this option to enable security at the 
component level. When selected, components and reports on virtual pages are 
'Always Denied' by default and must be have permissions set. Grids on pages use 
the page permission. If this option is checked an 'Enforce security at the 
component level for AJAX components' option appears below it in the 'Customize 
Options' list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Enforce security at the component level for AJAX components</i></u> - 
AJAX enabled components on pages use the page permission. Checking this option 
will force all Ajax actions to use the component security permissions defined in 
the Web Security instead of the page permission. All components opened by 
Javascript or by virtual pages always use the component security permissions if 
component security is enabled. This option appears if the Enable component 
security for 'virtual pages'<u> </u>option is checked. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Ask browser to not cache requests requiring login</i></u> - Check this 
option to ask a browser to turn off caching for any item that requires login. 
This ONLY applies to requests for items that require login to view. This will 
normally cause the browser to make a new request for a page if the browser 
'back' or 'forward' buttons are used. Caching will still be permitted if 
security is off, or the page or component requested is always allowed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Cache lifetime (in seconds)</i></u> - The security settings are cached 
on the server for improved speed and are not automatically updated when the new 
settings are published. The cache lifetime (in seconds) determines how often the 
server will check for updates. A value of 300 will allow the server to check for 
new published settings every 5 minutes. Set the value to 0 to never check for 
updates.</p>

<a name="Overview of Page Security"></a><h4>Overview of Page Security</h4>

<p>Web security can be set for a specific page, all file types with specific 
file extensions, all files in a folder, or all file types with a specific file 
extension in a folder. Permissions are checked in the following order. Once a 
permission is found for a page or file that is 'allow' or 'requires login', no 
additional security options are tested.</p>
<p>Specific Page or File - </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>- A specific file or page can be set as 'allowed' or 'requires login'</p>
	<p>- A page set as 'allowed' will always be allowed, regardless of any 
	permission set at a folder level or for the file type</p>
	<p>- A page set as 'login' will only be permitted if a user is logged in 
	with appropriate permissions to see the groups assigned to the page. If a 
	user does not have permission, the page will always be denied regardless of 
	any permissions set at the folder level or for the file type.</p>
	<p>-A page without permission will only be allowed if the file type is 
	allowed, or the file is in a folder that allows all files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Files Types Always Allowed</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>- Permissions for file types by extension can be set at a global level.</p>
	<p>- Permissions set globally apply to all files in the project, regardless 
	of the folder location Additional security may be set at the folder level.</p>
	<p>- Some file types are set by default in the system, such as Javascript 
	and CSS files. These file types can either be 'allowed' or 'denied', but can 
	not be removed from the file type list.</p>
	<p>- Additional file types can be added at the global level and can be 
	'allowed' or 'require login'.</p>
	<p>- A file type set as 'login' will only be permitted if a user is logged 
	in with appropriate permissions to see the groups assigned to the file type. 
	If a user does not have permission, that file type will always be denied 
	regardless of any permissions set at the folder level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Files in Folder</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>- Permissions can be set for all files in a folder</p>
	<p>- All files in the folder can be 'allowed' or set to 'require login'</p>
	<p>- If the folder is 'allowed', all files in the folder are allowed.</p>
	<p>- Files in a folder requiring 'login' will only be permitted if a user is 
	logged in with appropriate permission to see the groups assigned to the 
	folder. If a user does not have permission, files in the folder will not be 
	allowed.</p>
	<p>- Folder permissions are NOT checked for any pages or files in the folder 
	that have permission set at the page level to 'allow' or to 'login'. Page 
	permission takes precedence over folder permissions. </p>

<h4>About Component Security</h4>
<p>Web security is normally set for a specific physical page, or for controls 
and fields within a web component. 'Page Security' can limit access to a 
physical page based on the current logged in user permissions. The use of AJAX 
techniques allows Reports and AJAX enabled components to open in a 'virtual' 
page. An existing physical page uses Javascript to make a request to the server 
to construct the grid or report. This call does NOT request a physical page. The 
returned content is placed in a &lt;div&gt; or &lt;iframe&gt; on the page by Javascript. 
Because these AJAX requests do not open an actual page, 'Page Security' can Not 
be used to limit access to Reports and AJAX enabled components opened by 
request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Component security' allows setting permissions for Reports and AJAX enabled 
components when they are requested directly by an AJAX call the permissions set 
in 'Component Security' are NOT used if the Report or AJAX enabled component is 
opened by requesting a physical page.</p>
<p><u><i>Select All Components with the Same Permissions as the Current

<p><u><i>Requires Login Option</i></u> - </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The requires login option is the third option on the list that appears when 
you set a permission or permissions for a single or selected group of 
components. If you check this option a dialog will appear to ask you which 
groups you would like to be able to see the login. After setting who will be 
allowed to see the component click Ok. The component with the 'Requires login' 
permission should now have a lock icon next to it in the Component Permissions 
list.&nbsp; If a component requires a login you should select at least one group 
for that component in the dialog that loads after clicking 'Requires Login'; 
Otherwise if you click Ok you will get the following error message. </p>
<p align="center">

Publishing data tables will overwrite any user data for this project on the 
server. Web security requires that the Web Security Framework is enabled on the 
server. If the security settings are configured to activate security, but the 
security framework is not enabled on the server, no security rules will be 
enforced.</p>

<a name="Maintenance Capabilities in the Web Security System"></a><h2>Maintenance Capabilities in the Web Security System.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Alpha Anywhere web security system also includes a number of options 
designed to assist the developer in maintaining the system. You may access and 
edit the security related fields in the user table from the Users and Groups 
dialog or from a web based form. A developer may design a standard dialog 
component following some simple rules and then very easily add the capability to 
populate the form with an existing user record, create a new user record, 
validate all data entered, and then save the results. This is done with a few 
simple function calls added to the dialog component server events. You can then 
add the dialog component to a page to allow editing the information directly on 
the web.
The users and group assignments shown on the Users and Groups dialog may not be 
the same as the values used by the application on the server. All of the web 
security tables are published to the application folder on the server and do not 
reside in the same location as other data files. If the security configuration 
allows a web user to edit information on line, the user information in the 
published location will be different than in the local files. The Web Security 
Menu has an additional option named Utilities. This opens the Retrieve Web User 
Data dialog. This option will retrieve the data on the server for the 
application and replace the local user files with the user files from the 
published location. All existing local user, group, and permission data will be 
replaced with the data retrieved from the published files. This option is also 
available from the Users and Groups dialog Import Users option. 
Additional functions are available for use on a web page to return information 
about a current logged in user. This information can include almost any data 
from the user record and limited information about the security group assignment 
for the user. A security settings option exists to automatically create a 
session variable to hold a value from the user security table 'ulink' field if 
the field is activated. This information could then be used for other purposes, 
such&nbsp;as&nbsp;filtering records for display.

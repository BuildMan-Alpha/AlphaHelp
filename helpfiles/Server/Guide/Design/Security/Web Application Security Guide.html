<h3>Web Security Configuration </h3>
	
	<h4 align="left">Security Policy</h4>
<h4 align="center"><br>
<img border="0" src="images/A_Security_Policy_Page.png" width="716" height="502"></h4>
	<p><u><i>Security active<b> </b></i></u>- If security is not activated, all objects and actions will be available to all users without restriction. 
	If security is active, the security system is based on membership in a group.
	
	</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Password Required</i></u> - Select to require a password as well as a User ID for login. A User ID is always required if security is active. 
If you check this box you can set password options under the 'User Id and 
Password Options' tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Redirect page</i></u> - login. This is the name of the page to go to if login is required to access a selected page. This would normally be the login page, or a menu or index page. 
If you do not have a page designated you can type one in here</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Redirect page</i> - <i>insufficient permission</i></u>. If a logged in 
user does not have permission to access a selected page they will be redirected 
to this page. If this page is not specified, they will be redirected to the page 
specified for login.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Use Active Directory</i></u> - Select this option if you want to use 
Active Directory for security data on your production server. See &quot;Using Active 
Directory&quot; link at the bottom of the dialog for more information. </p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Checking the 
User Active Directory will change the 'Security Table Type' setting to 'Security 
Table Type for Development and Testing'. Checking this box will also remove the 
'Data Recovery Options' tab from the top of the Security Settings dialog box. It 
will truncate the setting options that are available under 'User Id and Password 
Options' tab and the 'Customize Options' tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Security Table Type for Development and Testing</i></u> - Select the 
data type for storing the web security data that will be used during development 
and testing of the application. The production deployment of the application 
will use Active Directory for user authentication and authorization. If the type 
is changed from 'DBF Files' to 'SQL Database', a genie will open when the 
security settings are saved to set the connection to the SQL database and define 
the tables to construct.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_Web_Secuity_Data_DBF_SQL.png" width="556" height="387"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Selecting Data Type for Storing Security Data</b></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;If the type is changed from 'SQL database to 'DBF Files', 
a prompt will display on save to confirm the conversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Security Table Type</i></u> - As long as the 'Use Active Directory' 
Setting is not checked this option will remain open. Select the data for storing 
the web security data. If the type is changed from 'DBF Files' to 'SQL 
Database', a genie will open when the security settings are saved to set the 
connection to the SQL database and define the tables construct. If the type is 
changed from 'SQL database' to 'DBF Files', a prompt will display on save to 
confirm the conversion.
	
	</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Allow Alternative Login</i> </u>- The 'Use Active Directory' Setting 
must be unchecked to see this option. Allow alternative login bascially allows 
the use of an alternative login method to authenticate and login the user; such 
as Google. If you click the check box next to this option two more settings 
appear below it.
	
	</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<i>Automatically Add Authenticated User to Security</i> - 
An authenticated user can automatically be added to the system if they do not 
already have a security record. In the case where the user's identifier from the 
external authentication system does not meet the userId configuration 
requirements in the security system, a unique user id will be generated using 
the user identifier. If the user information is accepted, they will be logged 
into the system when the information is saved.&nbsp;
	
	</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<i>After login Event</i> - The ''afterLogin' event fires 
after a user has successfully been logged in using an external authentication 
method. This event includes variables available after login.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	
	
	
	<h4>Login Options</h4>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_Login_Options_Page.png" width="720" height="532"></p>
<p><u><i>Login expiration policy</i></u> - Policy to set the maximum login time 
period. All options other than 'Expires when current session expires' require 
the use of a cookie. If the user does not have cookies enabled, they will be 
logged out when the session expires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Lockout after failed attempts</i> </u>- The number of times a user can 
try to login unsuccessfully before they are locked out of the application. Set 
to 0 to allow unlimited attempts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Locked out action</i></u> - The action that should be taken if a user 
is locked out of the system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'Wait for period of time' will require the user to wait a 
specified time until they are allowed to login with the same User ID. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'Redirect to another page' Will send them to another 
page. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'Lockout user until reset by administrator' will lock out 
the User ID until lock is manually released. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Locked out message</i></u> - Message to show the user during login to 
indicate they are locked out of the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Locked out wait Time</i></u> - Click on the box with three dots to the 
right and the Expiration Time dialog box will load. This allows you to set the 
locked out wait time.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/A_Expiration%20time.png" width="244" height="212"></p>
<p><u><i>Login activity file</i></u> - When enabled this will save all login 
activity to a text file in the specified folder. If you click the checkbox, 
three option will appear below the login activity file in the list. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'<i>Login activity log to save to</i>' - Folder where 
activity log file will be saved. Select 'User defined function' to enter your 
own code to process log activity data.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;The 'Data folder option' does... and the 'Project 
Target Folder' does...</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'<i>Login activity include failed</i>' - When enabled, 
all failed attempts to log in will be recorded in the login activity log. If not 
checked, only successful logins are recorded in the log file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<i>'Login activity include logout</i>' - When enabled, 
any user logged out by the 'a5ws_logoutuser()' function will be recorded in the 
login activity log. No log entry will be created if no one is logged on when the 
log out function is called. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Login redirect option</i></u> - Note: Login redirect only applies when 
a login component is used for login. This determines the action to take after a 
successful login. Select,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<i>Current page</i>' if the user should stay on the page 
containing the login component. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<i>Same page'</i> for all logins' to send all users the 
same page after login. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<i>Page assigned by user profile</i>' to allow setting a 
specific page in the user profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Redirect page after login (when using login component)</i></u> - This 
is the name of the page to go to after a successful login. If the redirect 
option is 'Page assigned by user', this page will be used if a redirect page is 
not assigned in the current user profile.</p>
<p>Note: Login redirect only applies when a login component is used for login 
(as opposed to a Tabbed UI or UX component with integrated Login).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><i>Ignore return to page after login</i></u> - When a person attempts to 
open a page or component for which they do not have permission, they are 
redirected to the login page. The default action is to always redirect to the 
page specified by the 'Login redirect option' and the 'Redirect page after login 
(when using login component)'. Uncheck this to return to the previous page.
<font color="#FF0000">This option is automatically checked if component </font>
</p>
<p>Note: Login redirect only applies when a login component is used for login 
(as opposed to a Tabbed UI or UX component with integrated Login).&nbsp; </p>

<h1>Overview</h1>
Active Directory authentication and authorization can be used in 2 different ways in Alpha Anywhere:
<ol>
  <li>
  Use an Active Directory rather than a custom database to validate credentials that a user enters into a login page.
  </li>
  <li>
  "Windows Integrated Authentication"
whereby a user and the server are in the same Active Directory domain and
an automatic negotiation can be done to identify the user*.
  </li>
</ol>
*Windows Integrated Authentication is not yet implemented in Alpha Anywhere Application Server, but is coming soon. 
It is implemented in the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS beta as of build 2358.
<br>
<h1>Assumptions</h1>
The Active Directory store is treated as read only by Alpha Anywhere.
Management of Active Directory users and groups is outside the scope of
Alpha Anywhere and is left to the Active Directory administrator's
usual tools.<br>
<br>
A web application that uses a form to collect user credentials should run over HTTPS so that the credentials are
encrypted when transmitted from the browser to the server.<br>
<h1>Using Active Directory Authentication and Authorization</h1>
<h2>Set Web Security Configuration</h2>
<p>Edit the Web Security Configuration for your web project.</p>
<a href="./Active Directory Integration_files/web-security-dialog.png"><img src="./Active Directory Integration_files/web-security-dialog.png" alt="Web security configuration icon in the web security dialog."></a>
<p>Select the "Use Active Directory" option. The prompt below this option will change to read "Security Table Type for Development 
and Testing". DBF File or SQL Database will still be used for developing and testing of the application. This means you can develop 
and test the application without having or needing to have access to the production Active Directory domain. The group names used 
during development and testing do need to be the same as in the Active Directory. The "Web User and Groups" dialog "Groups" tab 
allows <a href="#users-and-groups">group names to be imported</a> from an Active Directory or a text file. Create or edit the publish 
profile settings for the production web server to configure the Active Directory server used in production. Publish profile setting 
for development and test servers should use the custom DBF file or SQL database.
</p>
<a href="./Active Directory Integration_files/security-settings.png"><img src="./Active Directory Integration_files/security-settings.png" alt="Security settings dialog."></a>
<p>Select the remainder of security settings needed like the redirect pages.</p>
<a name="users-and-groups"></a>
<h2>Users and Groups</h2>
<p>While users and groups are now used through Active Directory, developing and testing the web application against a production Active 
Directory server can be impractical because you may not have access to the Active Directory server. For this reason you will want to 
create users and groups to be stored in a DBF file or SQL database.  These users and groups will be used during development and 
<a href="http://downloads.alphasoftware.com/A5V12Download/ReleaseNotes/ActiveDirectory/UsingActiveDirectory.html#testing">testing</a>.
</p>
<p>In order to work in this way the name of the groups you want to secure against must be spelled the same way as they are stored in the 
Active Directory. If you only have a few you can manually enter the groups and add some users as members of the groups. Otherwise, you can 
import groups directly from Active Directory or from a file.
</p>
<a href="./Active Directory Integration_files/import-groups.png"><img src="./Active Directory Integration_files/import-groups.png" alt="Web users and groups dialog with the groups tab selected and the import groups link highlighted."></a>
<p>
  
</p>
<a href="./Active Directory Integration_files/import-ad-groups.png"><img src="./Active Directory Integration_files/import-ad-groups.png" alt="Import Active Directory groups dialog."></a>
<p>
Importing groups gives you the option to merge into existing groups (add group names not already in
the list), overwrite existing groups (delete all groups before adding groups being imported), and 
include a test user in each group. 
</p><div class="note"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note</span>: As of build 2358 the format of the group name as changed. It is now 
prefixed with the domain name e.g. ACME\Human Resources. Groups that were imported or entered before build 2358 will need to be 
reimported or manually updated to include the domain prefix. This change is required to support integrated authorization under IIS.
</div>
<br>
<div class="note"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note</span>: When you select to include a test user in a group the test user's name will 
be the group name prepended with "TestUser-" and the test user's password is set to the string "password". <br><br>
Example: A group name of "Engineering" will get a test user with the name "TestUser-Engineering".
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="note">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Caution</span>: When "Overwrite existing groups" is selected, existing groups will be deleted. 
This means that any existing page, component or component control's security settings are removed and will have to be reapplied.  
</div>
<br>
<p>
To import groups from a file change the Group name source to "File". Then specify a file that has the
name of each group on a separate line. A test user name can be include for the groups too. The test user 
name follows the group name on the same line. Two tab characters are between the group name and the test user name. 
The format of the test user name is the test user's name followed by a | character and then 
the SAM-Account-Name for the test user. Example: John Doe|jdoe. 
</p>
<p>
A command line tool named <span style="font-family:monospace;">A5ActiveDirectoryExport.exe</span> is 
included in the Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition install for generating a file from an 
Active Directory that can be imported by Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition. This stand alone exe file
can be sent to anyone who has access to Active Directory to create a file for import. The command 
line options are:  
</p><table class="command-line-options">
<tbody><tr>
<td>-h</td><td>Show the command line options.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-d</td><td>Specify a domain name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-u</td><td>Username that has permission to access Active Directory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-p</td><td>password of the Username that has permission to access Active Directory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-iu</td><td>Include a group's users.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-ou</td><td>Restrict groups that are output to a specific organizational unit.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p></p>
<p>Example usage:</p>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace;">A5ActiveDirectoryExport -iu &gt; ad.txt</span></p>
<p>This will create a file named ad.txt that will contain groups and test users for current user's
domain and will access Active Directory with the current user's identity. The test user names and SAM-Account-Name 
that are generated are the same. Example: TestUser-Engineering|TestUser-Engineering.
</p>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace;">A5ActiveDirectoryExport -iu -ou "East Coast"&gt; adEastCoast.txt</span></p>
<p>This will create a file named adEastCoast.txt that will contain groups and test users for current user's
domain in the organizational unit of "East Coast" and will access Active Directory with the current user's identity. The test user 
names and SAM-Account-Name that are generated are the same. Example: TestUser-Engineering|TestUser-Engineering.

<h2>Publishing an Application</h2>
<p>
In order to use Active Directory in a web application the publishing profile must define an Active Directory configuration.
The create publish profile genie adds a security store type for the Active Directory configuration if the security settings has the 
"Use Active Directory" option set. This will be the last page of the genie.
</p>
<a href="./Active Directory Integration_files/publish-profile-active-directory-page.png"><img src="./Active Directory Integration_files/publish-profile-active-directory-page.png" alt="Create publishing profile Active Directory genie page."></a>
<p>When the "Configure Active Directory" button is selected the Active Directory Configuration 
dialog is shown. If an Active Directory server is detected the fields will default to use that Active Directory server.
</p>
<p>
Select an Active Directory configuration mode to be used. 
</p><ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Form based authentication</span> - The user will need to enter their Windows credentials 
  (username and password) in a login page and the server will validate the credentials against an Active Directory server. This 
  mode can be used for an internet or intranet web application and&nbsp;should only be used with HTTPS to protect the \
  confidentiality of the user's credentials.<br><br>
    <a href="./Active Directory Integration_files/active-directory-configuration-dialog.png"><img src="./Active Directory Integration_files/active-directory-configuration-dialog.png" alt="Create publishing profile Active Directory genie page."></a>
  </li><br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Integrated authentication</span> - This mode of authentication is also known as single sign on 
  and does not require a user to enter credentials. When using this mode the machine the user is logged into and the server the 
  web application is on are both in the same Windows domain. An automatic negotiation is done between the browser and the server in 
  order to identify the user. This mode is typically used in a corporate intranet supporting internal web applications.<br><br>
    <div class="note">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: This mode is only available in the Alpha Anywhere Application Server beta for IIS at this time. It will be coming soon to the Alpha Anywhere Application Server.
    </div>
    <br>
    <a href="./Active Directory Integration_files/active-directory-configuration-integrated-dialog.png"><img src="./Active Directory Integration_files/active-directory-configuration-integrated-dialog.png" alt="Create publishing profile Active Directory genie page."></a>
    <br>There is an additional option to "Impersonate user" when Integrated authentication is selected. Choose this option when server 
	resources need to be accessed as the logged in user. Examples of server resources are files and/or folders on the server or 
	a SQL database.
    <br><br>
    <div class="note">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: In order for a web application use integrated Windows authentication you must unlock 
	  the system.webServer/security/authentication/windowsAuthentication section in IIS. This can be done by setting the feature delegation 
	  for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Authentication - Windows</span> to Read/Write.
      <br><br><a href="./Active Directory Integration_files/feature-delegation.png"><img src="./Active Directory Integration_files/feature-delegation.png" alt="Feature delegation setting for Authentication - Windows."></a>
	  <br>
	  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: Windows Authentication is site specific. If you publish a web application to a site sub-folder and the web application uses integrated Windows authentication, Windows Authentication must be enabled in the site's root web application.
	  <br><br>
	  Example: This publish profile publishes a web application to a folder named TestActiveDirectory in the Default Web Site.
      <br><br><a href="./Active Directory Integration_files/publish-profile.png"><img src="./Active Directory Integration_files/publish-profile.png" alt="Publish profile to Test Active Directory folder in the Default Web Site."></a>
	  <br>
	  In this case make sure the Default Web Site authentication setting has Windows Authentication enabled.
      <br><br><a href="./Active Directory Integration_files/site-authentication-setting1.png"><img src="./Active Directory Integration_files/site-authentication-setting1.png" alt="Get to site authentication setting for Windows Authentication."></a>
	  <br><a href="./Active Directory Integration_files/site-authentication-setting2.png"><img src="./Active Directory Integration_files/site-authentication-setting2.png" alt="Site authentication setting for Windows Authentication."></a>
	  <br>
	  </div>  
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
To change a publish profile's Active Directory configuration locate the Active Directory settings in the publish profile's
Miscellaneous section of the property sheet. Change the security store type to change whether an Active 
Directory configuration is published and/or change the Active Directory configuration by clicking on the smart field button in 
the "Configure Active Directory" option.
</p>

<a name="testing"></a>
<h2>Testing an Application</h2>
<p>
When testing and developing a web application it is necessary to validate correct user authorization to parts of the application. 
For instance, the web application may have a back office component that should only be available to users in the "web app administrator" 
group. This is why users can still be defined in the web project's security settings. When publishing to a test environment, instead 
of defining an Active Directory configuration publish the Alpha Anywhere security tables so that they will be used for authentication 
and authorization instead of Active Directory. This give the ability to accurately test authorization. 
</p>
<div class="note"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note</span>: If your test environment includes a test Active Directory domain you, 
of course, can define an Active Directory configuration to that test Active Directory domain in your publish profile for the test 
environment.

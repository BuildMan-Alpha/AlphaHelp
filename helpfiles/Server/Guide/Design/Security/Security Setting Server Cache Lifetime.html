<br />
The web security settings and permissions are cached on the server for improved speed and are <em>not </em>automatically updated when the new settings are published.<br />
<br />
	<img src="images/security cache lifetime.png" alt="Image" /><br />
<br />
�	V11 uses a server cache to hold security settings for an application.<br />
�	The cache is cleared when the application server is started and restarted.<br />
�	The security settings for an application are loaded into the cache when the first request is made for the application.<br />
�	The security cache on the local application server running in the current Alpha Five instance is cleared when anything is published to �Local Webroot�.  Therefore any changes to the settings will be reflected in the next request to the local server after publishing any file from the project.<br />
�	If revised security settings are published to a remote server, the remote server cache is NOT cleared after publish.  Therefore any changes made to security settings are NOT applied until the cache is reloaded.<br />
<br />
The cache lifetime (in seconds) determines how often the server will check for updates to the security files.  A value of 300 (the default) will allow the server to check for new published settings or values every 5 minutes.  If new security files were published and the cache lifetime has not expired, they will <em>not </em>be applied until the next time scheduled for an update check.<br />
<br />
�	Set the value to a few seconds if publishing to a remote server and the new values should be loaded as soon as possible.  This may cause a slight speed impact and should only be done for testing.<br />
�	Set the value to 0 to never check for updates.  This would be a recommended value for a production server where security updates are rare.  If a change is published, stopping and restarting the server will clear the cache and force a reload of security settings.<br />

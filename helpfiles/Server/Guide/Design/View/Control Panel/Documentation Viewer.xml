		<title>Note about images in the documentation.</title>
		<description>When you first view a particular topic in the Documentation Viewer, the images in the topic are displayed from the Alpha Wiki website. This means that in order to see the images you would need to have an internet connection. However, as the images are retrieved from the wiki, they are cached locally so that the next time you visit that particular topic, the images will be read from the local cache. That means that if you are viewing the documentation and you do not have an internet connection, topics that were previously viewed when a connection was available will show images, but if you have not previously viewed the topic, the images will not be visible.</description>

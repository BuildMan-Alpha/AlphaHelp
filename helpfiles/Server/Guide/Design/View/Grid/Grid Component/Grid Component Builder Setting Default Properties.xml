	<topic>Grid Component Builder - Setting Default Properties
</topic>
<description>The Options, Set Default Properties command in the Grid Builder has always allowed you to set default properties for the Grid when you create a new Grid. However, if you created a new Grid from a Template, the default properties that you set were not honored. They were only honored if you created a blank new grid. Now, the default properties are used even if you use a template. This makes it much easier to customize the Grid builder for developers whose native language is not English.</description>

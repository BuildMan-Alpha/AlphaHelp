		<description>Occasionally, (typically after installing a patch) you might encounter an error when Alpha Anywhere tries to render some HTML content. Or the error might occur in a dialog that has a Property Grid control. These errors are the result of one of the DLL files that Alpha Anywhere uses becoming 'unregistered'. Generally, reinstalling Alpha Anywhere will fix the problem, but now two special batch files (one for Vista/Windows 7 user, and one for XP users) are included to make re-registering all necessary files very easy. The batch files are in the Alpha Anywhere program folder and are:</description>
		<cases>
			<case>
				<description>RegisterFiles.bat </description>
			</case>
			<case>
				<description>RegisterFilesVistaWin7.bat </description>
			</case>
		</cases>

<description>If you are using Vista or Windows 7 you must run the appropriate batch file using Administrator privileges.
 To run the batch file:</description>		
		<cases>
			<case>
				<description>Open Windows Explorer. </description>
			</case>
			<case>
				<description>Navigate to the folder where Alpha Anywhere is installed and then right click on the appropriate batch file. </description>
			</case>
			<case>
				<description>Select the 'Run as administrator' command. </description>
			</case>
			
		</cases>
		<note>The RegisterFilesVistaWin7.bat file will register .dll and .ocx files. You should also run the dhtmled.msi installer to repair the Internet Explorer ActiveX control, especially if you see an error that says object.Refresh method not found. Alpha Anywhere uses this control to render HTML in many places (such as the Grid builder, HTML editor, etc.)</note>

	<description>Once you have a working custom component, you can share it with others by sending them the .A5WCMP file that contains the component. They will need to copy it into their web project folder to use it. If your component uses Xbasic functions in an AEX file, or your component uses CSS or JavaScript files, you will need to supply those files as well.

 If you or another user of the component needs to use multiple copies of the component with different argument values, simply duplicate the component in the Web Projects Control Panel.

 If you have exposed arguments in your component, you can bind them to other components. For example, the Demo component we created can be linked to any grid that has a State field.

 If you need more flexibility than you can get from a Custom Component, consider migrating the code from your Custom Component to a User-defined Component.</description>

		<description>A developer wanted to save the value of a grid field that was being used to link to a second page. The solution encodes the value of the field into the URL of the target page. This creates a session variable when the second (target) page appears.

The following URL opens the Showsubscriber.A5w page with the filter expression edit_sub_filter=Acct_Id={Acct_Id}. In addition, it creates the session variable session.CurrentSubAcct set to the value found in the Acct_Id field.

		<example><![CDATA[Showsubscriber.A5w?edit_sub_filter=Acct_Id={Acct_Id}&session.CurrentSubAcct={Acct_Id}
 ]]></example>
		<note>All variables created as part of a URL are of type character.</note>

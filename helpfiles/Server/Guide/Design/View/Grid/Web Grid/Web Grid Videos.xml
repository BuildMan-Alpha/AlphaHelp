				<title>Client-side Show/Hide Expressions can use Animation</title>
				<description>The Grid and Dialog component both allow you to define client-side show/hide expressions to dynamically hide and show controls on a component. Now, you can associate an animation effect with each show/hide expression you define. This video shows how you can do this.</description>

Note: This feature applies to both the Grid and the Dialog component. The video shows the feature in the Dialog component, but the feature operates in exactly the same way in the Grid.

				<title>Default Value for New Records when doing data entry in the Grid Part.</title>
				<description>The Grid allows you to enter new records directly in the Grid part, or in the Detail View part. The Grid builder allows you to specify default values for fields in new records. This can be done by either specifying the field's 'Initial Value' property, or by specifying code in the 'onInitialValueCalculate' event.

In the case where data entry is done in the Grid Part (as opposed to the Detail View), the issue with the 'onInitialValueCalculate' event (which is a server-side event), is that it is only called once, when the Grid is initially rendered. So, if you enter a new record and then save that record, the event is not called before the next new record is displayed. This video shows how you can save the value of a field that was just entered inside the Grid's 'stateInfo' object, and then use the 'afterRowPopulate' event to retrieve that value and use it as a default in the next new record.
Note: The .setValue() method is not used to set the value of the field in the new record row because this would cause the new record row to go 'dirty'. Instead we get a pointer to the element and then simply set its value property.

				<title>Grid and Dialog Component - Client-side Mask - Dynamically Setting the Mask at Run-time</title>
				<description>You can now specify a Javascript function to dynamically compute the mask for a control. The Javascript function gets called every time the control gets focus. When the Javascript function gets called, it can read data in the current Grid row, (or Dialog) and compute the mask to use based on this data. For example, say you have a mask for a telephone number field. In the US, UK and Europe, different formats are used for telephone numbers. The Javascript function can decide what format string to return based on the current value of the 'COUNTRY' field.</description>

				<title>Grid Component - Setting Default Initial Properties - International Developers</title>
				<description>The Options, Set Default Properties command in the Grid Builder has always allowed you to set default properties for the Grid when you create a new Grid. However, if you created a new Grid from a Template, the default properties that you set were not honored. They were only honored if you created a blank new grid. Now, the default properties are used even if you use a template. This makes it much easier to customize the Grid builder for developers whose native language is not English.</description>

				<title>Repository Table - Managing Records in the Repository</title>
				<description>This video is aimed at advanced used who use the Repository feature in V11. 

The video shows how you can create a Grid to manage the records in the Repository that 'belong' to the current component.

For example, when you save search criteria from the Search Part of a Grid to the Repository, the search is saved with the GUID of the current component. This is important because when you load a saved search, you only want the user to see the saved searches that 'belong' to the current component. If you want to manage the records in the Repository, (by creating a Grid that is based on the Repository table), you might want to filter the records in the Repository based on the Guid of a particular component. 

Say you have a Grid called 'Customers' and you want to put a button on this Grid to show the Repository entries that belong to this Grid. You can do this by setting the filter on the target Grid to

componentGuid = ComponentGuid()

Important Note: Ajax windows that contain IFrames, which in turn contain display PDF files cannot be animated. As a result, the Animation property has not been made available for Ajax windows that host .a5w pages (since .a5w pages are hosted in an IFrame).
You can control the animation effect for the window display and the window close. You can also control the animation speed.
Certain animation styles will mess up the positioning of windows. If you find this to be the case, you should stick with the 'Fade' style for the 'show' animation.

				<title>Abstract CSS Class Names</title>
				<description>V11 Introduces the concept of 'Abstract CSS Class Names'. When you design a Component, all of the HTML is now marked up using abstract CSS class names (e.g. class.gridPartSelect). A class map defines how the abstract CSS class name maps to the physical class names in your CSS stylesheets. 

This is a very powerful concept because it gives you very granular control over the styling of different elements in your components. These videos explain the concept in more detail.

				<title>Action Javascript - Binding an Argument Value to Result of a Javascript Function</title>
				<description>(This video is aimed at advanced developers). When you use Action Javascript to open a Grid, Report, Dialog, Custom Component, etc. you often need to bind the value of an argument to a value from the parent Component. For example, you might bind the value of 'arg1' to the value of the Lastname field in the current Grid row.

Now, instead of binding an argument to the value of a field in the Grid, you can specify an arbitrary Javascript function to execute. The argument is bound to the value that this Javascript function returns.

				<description><![CDATA[(This video is aimed at advanced developers). When a client-side show/hide event fires, you can now define your own Javascript function that will get called. 

This video shows an interesting use of this functionality. In the video, we show a Grid with a Detail View. In the Detail View, a large number of fields are hidden by show/hide client-side events. The space taken up by the hidden controls is not completely eliminated because the controls are contained in rows (<tr> tags) that are not hidden. We use the Javascript function to hide the empty <tr> tags. (Requires build 3816 or above)

				<title>Tabbed UI on Mobile Device</title>
				<description>A very common pattern when building Web Applications in Alpha Five is to use the Tabbed UI component as the 'home page' for the app. All of the pages and components in the app are accessed from the Tabbed UI. However, when running on a mobile device (tablet or phone), the Tabbed UI consumes too much real estate.

This video shows how you can set a property in the Tabbed UI to change the way in which the Tabbed UI component renders so that it is more appropriate for a mobile devide.

				<title>Filtering a Grid Based on the Current Logged in User </title>
				<description>Data in a Grid can be filtered based on the current logged in user. This video shows how to set a filter in a Grid so that only data for the current logged in user is shown.

				<title>Communicating Between Components - Sending Commands from one Component to Another asdf </title>
				<description>Often, when your application is displaying multiple components on the screen at the same time you will want to send a command from one component to another component.

These videos build on concepts discussed in video M43

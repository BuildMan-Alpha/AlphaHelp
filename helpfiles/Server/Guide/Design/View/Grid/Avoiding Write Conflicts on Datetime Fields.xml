			<description>If you choose a date/time format that does not include seconds for a grid text field, but store seconds in the DATETIME field in your database, you can encounter write conflicts if the stored values have non-zero seconds.
 For example, you might choose this as your date/time format:
</description>
			<example><![CDATA[time("{grid.clientSideDateFormat} 0h:0m",<value>) ]]></example>
		</section>
		<section>
			<description>This would normally not be a problem, unless the value in your database that you are trying to update were something like this:

 </description>
			<example><![CDATA[2012-01-19 12:54:23 ]]></example>
			<note>It is important to note the 23 seconds here</note>
		</section>
		<section>
			<description>So, the value that you send back to the server as the original value for the field will therefore be:

</description>
			<example><![CDATA[2012-01-19 12:54
 ]]></example>
		</section>
		<section>
			<description>This of course is not the same as 2012-01-19 12:54:23, and the grid will throw a write conflict.
 If you want to or are storing seconds in your date/time fields, you need to choose a date/time format that includes seconds,
 e.g.:</description>
			<example><![CDATA[time("{grid.clientSideDateFormat} 0h:0m:0s",<value>) ]]></example>
		
		<note>The 's' in the time format!

 If you don't want to display seconds in updateable grid date/time fields, then you need to clean your data on the server to remove the seconds.

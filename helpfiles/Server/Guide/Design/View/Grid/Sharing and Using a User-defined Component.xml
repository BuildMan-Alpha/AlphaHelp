	<description><![CDATA[Once you have a working User-defined Component, you can share it with others by sending them a Zip of the entire directory tree you used to create the User-defined Component builder. They will need to unpack it into their C:\ProgramData\Alpha Software\Alpha Five Version 11\Installations\<identifier>\UserDefinedWebComponentTypes directory, which they can find by using the Edit|Advanced|Open Folder where User-defined Components are Registered menu item from Alpha Five.]]></description>

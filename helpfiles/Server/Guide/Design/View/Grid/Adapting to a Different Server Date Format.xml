	<topic>Adapting to a Different Server Date Format</topic>
	<description>The application developer created a grid with a search component with a date field. The Application Server was located on a machine where the regional settings were set for US dates (i.e. MM/DD/YYYY ). The users, however, wanted to search using DD/MM/YYYY date formats. The solution was to edit the .A5W page that displays the component. </description>

	<note> The FixDateString() function makes it possible to adapt a web application used by persons who expect a YMD date format to a Application Server that uses a MDY date format.</note>

				<description>When the user clicks the search button, the variables are submitted with the page. The date1 search field have a value that looks like 31/12/2015. The above code intercepts this value and changes it to 12/31/2015 before the grid component sees it.</description>

	<description>Web publishing applications only. Users operate in an asynchronous manner when interacting with a database across the Internet. as a result, it is not possible to lock a record when an Internet user accesses it. There is no way to predict how long it will be before the transaction is completed.</description>

	<description>The Application Server uses what is known as Optimistic Record Locking. This means that it includes an extra copy of the unedited data in the page that is delivered to the user. When the page is submitted back to the Application Server, it checks to see if there is any difference between the record currently in the database and the extra copy in the page.

If there is no difference, then it safe to apply any changes made by the Internet user. If there is a difference, then the Application Server notifies the Internet user that there is a conflict, that someone has made a change to the data since the Internet user retrieved his copy of the data.

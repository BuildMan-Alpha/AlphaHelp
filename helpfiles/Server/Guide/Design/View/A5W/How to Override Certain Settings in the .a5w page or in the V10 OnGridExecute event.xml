	<topic>How to Override Certain Settings in the .a5w page, or in the OnGridExecute event</topic>
	<description>In V9 you could override any setting of the grid in the Override Settings section in the Xbasic code that loaded the Grid (in the .a5w page).
In V10, this is no longer possible (at least by default).</description>

		<description> That's because many of the grid template html and other settings are now computed from the Grid properties at design-time, rather than at runtime.

Many properties can still be set at run-time, but some properties cannot (by default). Typically properties that control the layout of the HTML, control definitions, update settings cannot be set at run-time because Alpha Five has already 'processed' these properties.

You can however force A5 to re-calculate certain parts of the Grid  (that are normally computed at design-time) at run-time by setting properties of the Grid.

For example, say you want to override a column heading at run-time with this code
</description>
		<example><![CDATA[tmpl.field_info[3].Column.Heading = "....here is my column heading...." ]]></example>
	</section>

		<description>This will not work because the column headings were computed at run-time,
However, it will work if you add this property:
</description>
		<example><![CDATA[tmpl.flagMustRecalculateGridLayoutAndControls = .t.
 tmpl.field_info[3].Column.Heading = "....here is my column heading...." ]]></example>
	</section>
	<section>
		<description>Note: In the above example, if your Grid is set to use a Form view, you can use the slightly faster tmpl.flagMustRecalcGridLayout property. e.g.</description>
		<example><![CDATA[tmpl.flagMustRecalcGridLayout = .t.
 tmpl.field_info[3].Column.Heading = "....here is my column heading...." ]]></example>
	</section>
	<section>
		<description>You can set the tmpl.flagMustRecalculateAllProperties property. This forces A5 to re-calculate all aspects of the Grid at run-time. This can be quite slow and should be avoided if possible. (It will delay the initial rendering of the Grid. Once the Grid is rendered, interacting with it will be back to normal speed. There will also be a similar delay when you interact with the Grid if your session expires and a new session needs to be instantiated.)

tmpl.flagMustRecalcSearchLayout

tmpl.flagMustRecalcDetailViewLayout

tmpl.flagMustRecalculateGridLayoutAndControls

tmpl.flagMustRecalculateDetailViewLayoutAndControls
 tmpl.flagMustRecalculateSearchLayoutAndControls

	<note>If you override the grid's SQL select statement at runtime in the OnGridExecute event by setting the e.tmpl.CS.SQL property, you must also override the grid's refresh row query by setting the e.tmpl.precalc.sql_refreshRowQuery property.</note>

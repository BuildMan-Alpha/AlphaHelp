		<description><![CDATA[In general, search engine spiders and crawlers have the capabilities of Lynx: they see HTML, but no images, no JavaScript, and no Flash. Google's can do a little more, but don't count on it for all of them.
 That means that a search engine can only see the first page of a grid, and almost nothing on a Tabbed UI. In the grid case, the HTML for the first page is generated before any JavaScript is called. In the Tabbed UI, JavaScript is used to populate the tabs.
 So how can you get search engines to index your content? The best way is to add content within <noscript>...</noscript> tags on your A5W page.
 For example, suppose you have created a parts catalog. If your Parts.a5w page displays a grid with 10 rows by default, the search engines will only index the links for the first 10 parts. But if you generate an HTML table inside of <noscript>...</noscript> tags that has links to all of the parts in the database, the search engine will see the links for all the parts.
 Because the Tabbed UI generates its own A5W page, it has a special property for defining the contents of the <noscript> section. ]]></description>

		<title>Your Project Folder</title>
		<description>Alpha Anywhere stores A5W pages that you are developing in a sub-folder under your database folder. Your project folder will be named: ...\ YourDatabaseName \ YourDatabaseName.WebProjects\ YourProjectName.WebProject\
You will store A5W pages, images, web components, images, and other files that you add to the project in this folder.
When you publish a page the "Local Webroot", Alpha Anywhere will copy the page and its components to the DocumentRoot.

</topic><description>If you use A5W_INCLUDE() to place a navigation component onto multiple A5W pages, you may want to have the current page highlighted on the menu.
Suppose the alias of the navigation component that you put on a page is NAV_INT. It will have a properties override section on the A5W page that looks like this.

	<description>Suppose the label of the tab that displays this page is "Sales Reps". You would then add a new entry to the override section that sets the value of the navigation component's location property. The following  location = "Sales Reps" statement will highlight the "Sales Reps" entry in the menu.

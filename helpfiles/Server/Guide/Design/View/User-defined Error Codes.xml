		<description>Alpha Anywhere has had a CallResult object since A5 Version 8. As of Version 11, we have reserved the error code range from 20000 to 24999 for User-defined Error Codes.

 You may define your own error codes by editing Alpha5.errors. We recommend keeping a backup of your additions so that you can easily merge them into any future versions of Alpha5.errors that we release.</description>

		<description>The script that calls Frizzbot() should check the returned CallResult immediately and proceed according to the returned values. The error string in Alpha5.errors will automatically populate Result.Text.

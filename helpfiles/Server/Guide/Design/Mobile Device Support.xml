	<description>Version 11's mobile capabilities use a different approach from most mobile web frameworks: we are not satisfied with least-common-denominator applications. </description>

	<description>We take full advantage of the capabilities of Webkit running on iPad and iPhone platforms, and degrade gracefully by disabling or replacing specific features on platforms that don't support them. So, for example, we support pinch-zoom and swipe gestures, momentum scrolling, and 3D transforms on iPad and iPhone; the same application running on a desktop browser would work without some of the nice effects, and with a scroll bar instead of touch-controlled momentum scrolling.

 We also take full advantage of the screen real estate on each device. You can, for example define a single grid with one query definition that has different layouts and behaviors for desktop browsers, tablets, and smart phones.

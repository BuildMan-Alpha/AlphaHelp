As Alpha Anywhere v11 is getting deployed more and more widely by&amp;nbsp;

businesses and organizations of all sizes,&amp;nbsp;we have been getting a lot&amp;nbsp;

of questions about building HIPAA compliant&amp;nbsp;health care applications.



So we asked&amp;nbsp;Jerry Brightbill from Alpha Software who has&amp;nbsp;

built &amp;nbsp;large&amp;nbsp;HIPAA compliant applications in hospital settings

using Alpha Anywhere Version 11&amp;nbsp;to share his thoughts.


The HIPAA&amp;nbsp;regulations have many requirements. &amp;nbsp;My suggestion is to
contact a security expert who is familiar with the&amp;nbsp;HIPAA regulations
to get a profession interpretation of the requirements. &amp;nbsp;Some of the
requirements are fairly clear cut, while others are open to judgment.
There are a couple gray areas that different analysts may give
different suggestions. &amp;nbsp;An expert in that field can also assist in
developing a strategy for documentation and rules on using the final
product.

The biggest impact of the regulations will be in the design of the
systems, data structures, and layouts. &amp;nbsp;The need to limit access and
track the access will drive the basic system and database design,
regardless of the programming tool used to actually construct the
project. &amp;nbsp;For example, you may not want to show any PHI (personal
health information) in any lists, but only show such data in a single
record view, such as a grid detail view or a single record page. &amp;nbsp;A
single record view is easier to restrict for access and makes saving
log information for capturing who viewed the data and who edited the
data much easier. In most cases, list views are used just for viewing
and selecting purposes, not for editing. &amp;nbsp;The requirements make
searching for records challenging as well, as often PHI data is used
for searches. &amp;nbsp;The developer and end user must decide what search
criteria is required and how it can be limited if needed. If you
examine existing solutions, you will find many incorprate similar
structures and design elements as many developers have reached simliar
conclusions about how to organize the data.

Some of the requirements are fairly clear cut, such as a need to
encrypt data and restrict physical access to the data servers. &amp;nbsp;Most
solutions use some type of SQL database engine such as MS SQL Server
as they include many inherent security features. &amp;nbsp;The Alpha Anywhere
native dbf table construction also provides encryption methods, but is
an older data format and doesn&#039;t provide security as granular as a SQL
based system. Alpha Anywhere includes very robust methods to connect to a
SQL based data structure and we have done extensive project work with
such structures.

Alpha Anywhere provides a number of tools to assist a developer in meeting
the requirements such as a sophisticated web security system that is
built into the server technology. &amp;nbsp;The web security system can limit
access to various elements by user role, which is a very critical
element in the regulations. &amp;nbsp;The web security can limit access to
whole pages, individual fields on a grid or form, and the ability to
insert, update, or delete records. &amp;nbsp;The security is applied in the
server for every file request and therefore is very secure. &amp;nbsp;For
example, by default all pages and files are not allowed unless
specifically set as always allowed or requiring login. &amp;nbsp;If they
require login, only members of assigned security groups will get the
file back from a request. &amp;nbsp;The security is even applied to every
image, css, and JavaScript file. &amp;nbsp;Alpha Anywhere Version 10 introduced
security at the component level and now every Ajax call to the server
is checked against the security settings as well.

When the security system restricts access to a field in a grid, the
field is not simply hidden, it is completely removed from the server
response and therefore the data never reaches the client computer.
This allows using a single construction for multiple user roles as
needed and access can be limited by role. &amp;nbsp;The system includes a built
in method to identify the current logged in user, as well as various
processes to get additional information about the user. &amp;nbsp;This can be
used to filter data based on the current user with relatively simple
coding.

The Alpha Anywhere grid construction includes a number of server side
events that make tracking changes to data relatively easy to track.
For example, when a record is updated, a system server side event
includes which fields were updated, as well as the data before and
after update. &amp;nbsp;This data can then be saved into some log file to
record the action. &amp;nbsp;Some developers using SQL server and similar SQL
backends will use code in the actual database to record editing
actions instead of using the Alpha Anywhere features.

The Alpha Anywhere events also make it possible to capture which data is
being presented to the user for viewing. &amp;nbsp;Most experts will conclude
you must track who views PHI data and what data they have viewed.
Code can be added to the events to meet this requirement.

Alpha Software has also done considerable work with a third-party
company that specializes in very secure data storage. &amp;nbsp;They provide a
lock box type system where sensitive data isn&#039;t even stored in your
databases. &amp;nbsp;Instead, they are stored in their very secure servers with
only cryptic security keys to identify the data. &amp;nbsp;Your local database
only stores a special key value in the secured fields, no actual data.
&amp;nbsp;When an operation requires the secured data for some need, the key
(and other information) can be used to recover the data stored in
their servers as required. &amp;nbsp;The lock box system is very secure and
transparent to the end user.

The success of such a project hinges on good basic design and the
right tool to implement the solution. I think you will find that Alpha
Five is a very effective tool to built to the design requirements of a
secure system.

Wendy Welton &amp;nbsp;a professional architect had a dream and she decided she wanted to take advantage of the web to market her home plans.

She tried some alternatives first but found the solution in Alpha Anywhere Version 11 because of the combination of usability, power and productivity.

We saw her comment on the Linked in group for Alpha Anywhere and thought it captured the essence of Alpha Anywhere in a uniquely clear way and decided we wanted to share it with you here on our blog

&quot;and I&#039;m not a professional developer - just an business owner with
dreams.&quot;

Here are some links from Wendy&#039;s new data-driven site built in Alpha Anywhere v11

This site uses the Alpha Anywhere v11 &quot;Power Search for Grids in Dialog Components Feature Pack&quot;
(The feature pack allows you to create a Power Search module to find
and filter records in a grid that has been embedded into your Version
11 dialog components.)&amp;nbsp;http://afhp.alpha5host.com/Search.a5w

And - here&#039;s another link
http://afhp.alpha5host.com/HomeownersGuide.a5w. If you click on any of
the options on the left, it will send you to the Search page and
prefill the appropriate check mark.

And she &amp;nbsp;also used the new Image Gallery feature

Few things get us as giddy as when an Access developer comes out of the closet and reveals how frustrated he is.&amp;nbsp;



DELETED: Microsoft has a history of 
abandoning its developers

Well, that just happened on the ArtfulOpinions blog, penned by our friend and fellow developer, Arthur. In his post, &quot;The Access Developer&#039;s Dilemma,&quot; Arthur outlines a history of Microsoft Access, from the release of the first version in 1992 up until the problem Access developers are faced with today. &quot;There
seems to be no future in continued Access development,&quot; Arthur writes.

But I can&#039;t do this post justice -- you&#039;ll have to read it for yourself. Head over to Arthur&#039;s blog, and don&#039;t be afraid to leave your opinion in the comment section, which has already sparked conversation.

Are you an Access developer frustrated with the limitations Arthur details in his post? Take a look at our newest white paper to find out how to move desktop Access apps to the web and mobile.

It&#039;s no secret that Microsoft Access isn&#039;t the best tool to use when developing for the web and mobile. But the way we see it, that shouldn&#039;t mean that developers still working on the desktop should be abandoned.

With Alpha Anywhere, Microsoft Access developers can take their soon-to-be-obsolete desktop apps and move them to the web and mobile. And Martin Heller, our Vice President of Education and Technology, is making sure Access developers know how to do just that with his latest publication, &quot;Alpha Anywhere Web Applications for Access Developers.&quot;&amp;nbsp;

For more details, take a look at the press release we distributed earlier today:

apps to the web

When we last checked in with Alpha developer Robin Bennett, his U.K.-based IT software development and consulting business, Start Software, had just finished an Alpha app modeled after Microsoft&#039;s metro UI. You can take a look at our previous post to see just how much Robin&#039;s app looked like a Windows 8 app.

But Robin didn&#039;t stop there. Shortly after he completed that app, he announced Start Software&#039;s adoption of Alpha Anywhere for web and mobile applications. Head over to our press release that has the details on Start Software&#039;s switch:



ADOPTING ALPHA: Start Software has seen an increase in proficiency and a decrease
in cost since choosing Alpha Anywhere 



&amp;nbsp;Thanks to Robin and everyone at Start Software for letting us share their story!

					When we released Alpha Anywhere Version 11, one of our first orders of business was to use it to strengthen our relationship with Tech Soup. 

Tech Soup is a global nonprofit organization that uses donated software to promote social change, and we&#039;ve been donating our software for years. Now, Alpha Anywhere Version 11 will be found in libraries throughout North America, giving libraries the technical support they need to stay current in a digital era.

Our latest donation of Version 11 topped out at a retail value of $365,000, and we issued a press release with all the details:



SUPER SOFTWARE: Alpha Anywhere has helped 7,000 libraries 


At Alpha Software, we&#039;re very aware of our social responsibility, and we love how Tech Soup gives us the ability to reach communities throughout the world.

Know of a library in your area that could use a boost? Leave it in a comment to have your community considered to be a recipient of Tech Soup&#039;s program.

					Two years ago, we found ourselves constantly being asked if Alpha Anywhere could scale in high volume situations. While we were getting great feedback on Alpha Anywhere, there&#039;s always a legitimate concern about scalability. 

Now, we have a new version with a lot more capabilities in environments such as mobile that require even more scalability. Because of that, we wanted to update you on why Alpha Anywhere is able to scale so well. There&#039;s no better way for me to do that than by talking about how we work with our partner, ZebraHost, one of the premier hosting platforms for Alpha Anywhere applications. 



ZEBRAHOST UPDATE: Who says a zebra can&#039;t change his stripes?

Over the past few years, ZebraHost has expanded to hosting in 13 data centers, all of which have passed SSAE 16 inspection. 

And while ZebraHost has always offered hosting options for organizations of any size, it recently started hosting to both public clouds and private clouds running Alpha Anywhere. Today, those developing in Version 11 can deploy multiple instances of their 
applications in any of the 13 global data centers, and load 
balance them within a particular data center or across several. 

For developers working with applications that store sensitive 
data, ZebraHost can now offer a hosted private cloud accessed by a secure VPN. With ZebraHost, no other customers share the resources of 
your private cloud, so your data will be securely located in a data 
center that&#039;s checked out with third-party security specialists. 

In addition to these expansions, ZebraHost has also implemented a number of new features:

Fully automated platform. All facets of the platform, such as cloud, networking, security, storage, and software services have been automated to accelerate provisioning, reduce human error, and provide Alpha Anywhere customers with the best end-user experience possible.



Network architecture. ZebraHost is now offering three networks all integrated into one public, private, and out-of-band management network for access and data transfer over dedicated carriers segregated from the public network.

Integrated geographical diversity. ZebraHost now offers servers in 13 data centers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Servers are connected through private, 10G point-to-point connections and integrated through automated tools.

On-demand dedicated servers and cloud computing instances (CCIs). ZebraHost can now deploy dedicated servers in two hours and CCIs in 15 minutes. They also offer additional services including hardware, firewalls, and load balancers as part of your initial order -- or whenever they&#039;re needed.

How have these updates to ZebraHost changed the way you develop web applications? Let us know in a comment!

You&#039;ll notice I&#039;m posting this at 11:11 a.m. What can I say? I like a good theme!&amp;nbsp;

Today we announced the release of our 11th feature pack, &quot;Power Search for Embedded Reports&quot; for Alpha Anywhere Version 11.&amp;nbsp;

No developer wants to buy bloatware that is loaded with features they will never need or use. That&#039;s why the core Alpha Anywhere Version 11 platform focuses on the tools and technologies that are crucial to build web and mobile database-driven applications.

However, we get mail. Lots of it. It&#039;s from developers asking us about specific features. We weigh these requests, and when we see a number of developers needing a particular feature, we bake that into a feature pack.&amp;nbsp;

This way, those developers that need specific features can get them while we&#039;re not overloading the core platform with features that are unnecessary for the bulk of our developers.&amp;nbsp;

So far, we&#039;ve produced 11 of these feature packs, and more are on the way as we continue to respond to the demands of our developers. And yes, if a certain feature pack takes off, it&#039;s entirely conceivable that that feature will find its way into the core platform at some point.&amp;nbsp;

There&#039;s more about our newest feature pack in the press release issues today:





11 IS THE MAGIC NUMBER: The 11th feature pack 
is &#039;Power Search for Embedded Reports&#039;

					Two birthday bones and some pupcakes! That&#039;s what we served this weekend at the birthday party for my uncles, Teige and Caspian. They mean a lot to me, and in fact, they&#039;re the reason I&#039;m here today.

Capsian and Teige have lived next door to our family since before I become a Rabins. They came to visit so often, everyone eventually they fell in love with Irish Setters. The rest is history! 

Here&#039;s a great video of the birthday boys chowing down on their homemade pupcakes:










We thought about going with one big cake, but because we needed a candle for each dog year, that posed some serious fire hazards. 

Other activities of the day included pin the tail on the cat; smashing a bone-shaped pinata filled with, well, bones; and bobbing for bacon.

Happy birthday Teige and Caspian!

When I found out that the term BYOD was referring to bringing personal technology to the workplace, and not bringing dogs to the workplace, I was disappointed.

We&#039;ve employed Clifton, my dog, as the Director of Sniff Testing for over a year now, and I was hoping that the trend would help Clifton meet other canine professionals. But then I saw Buddy, the furry secretary, working hard for a veterinarian&#039;s office:





Pretty impressive! Buddy, Clifton would like to know if you&#039;re interested in getting together for a bone some night after a long day of work!

Sometimes good news takes a little while to reach me. I recently heard that Groupama Insurance won an award for an app they built with Alpha Anywhere late last year. I reached out to Dave asking him to share his story, and he did.&amp;nbsp; 

Dave Wyatt, IT Systems Development Manager for the healthcare division  of Groupama Insurance, had been working in Alpha on his own time when he brought Alpha Anywhere to Groupama to see if it could solve the problem that his division had been struggling with. 

The company was using Java to develop its applications in the cloud. But Dave&#039;s division found that Java was taking too long, required too much maintenance, and needed highly skilled (and more costly) Java developers.

Dave decided to attempt to rewrite Groupama Insurance&#039;s administrative system for the healthcare division in Alpha Anywhere.

In about four months, the system Dave&#039;s division needed was up and running. When you factor in testing and deployment, the entire process took about six months. 

Today, the company relies on its simple, effective, and easy-to-understand administrative system, EasyAdmin, which is entirely powered by Alpha Anywhere. 

Just how good is the app? Well, like I said, Groupama was awarded the 2011 Best Online Intermediary Award for EasyAdmin. The award, presented by  Health Insurance Awards, is given once a year to brokers or  intermediaries in the healthcare industry.

And, by the way, if the system was built in Java, Dave would still be in the process of configuring what needed to be a simple, administrative app. 

Thanks to Dave for sharing his story!

					Everyone&#039;s familiar with captchas. Even if you don&#039;t recognize the word, you&#039;ve encountered them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 



The captcha is that distorted image of letters and numbers that you have
 to type in correctly before you can enter some websites.

The captcha, invented in 2000, makes sure that only humans (as opposed to automated software) are entering a site. Most IT guys know why captchas are there.

But what does the word stand for? I found out when UberFacts decoded the acronym in a recent tweet:




I shared this with my colleagues, and found out that none of them knew exactly what it stood for. But one thing everyone agrees on is that some captchas are pretty darn hard to decode and enter correctly. In fact, if you type &quot;captcha&quot;&amp;nbsp; in Google, you&#039;ll find that the suggested search is &quot;how to avoid captchas.&quot; That got me thinking. Could you create a captcha with Alpha Anywhere? And if you can, is it just as hard for developers to create as it is for users to decipher?

It turns out that not only is it possible, but it&#039;s easier than I thought. The option to generate captchas is already built into the dialog component. You&#039;ve probably even seen it before. You simply check the box that is appropriately labeled, and a captcha will be enabled for that field.






So, if you&#039;re using Alpha Anywhere, it&#039;s easier to create the captcha than it is to read it! Did you know what captcha stood for before this post? Let us know in a comment!

					Probably not the same thing that happened when Derryn Balogh, one of our customers, sent his idea to us. 

Derryn has been an Alphaholic for years, and recently tried his hand at developing apps with the new Alpha Anywhere Version 11. After we released the feature pack on how to create slider bars in the dialog component, Derryn reached out to let me know how much he has appreciated Selwyn&#039;s videos. In addition to his feedback, he also provided a suggestion on how to enhance Version 11. Here&#039;s the unedited email he sent me:


Hi Richard, 

The approach Alpha Anywhere has taken in presenting videos with an introduction, followed by separate &#039;step-by-step&#039; videos is fantastic. It gives people an understanding of what can be done, and the confidence in how to do it. WELL DONE, guys. 

The slider bar feature pack will be appreciated by many. It&#039;s a fantastic input tool that will be VERY useful.
Something that would make this feature pack even more valuable would be the ability to display an image dynamically, based on the input chosen by the user on the slider bar. Perhaps this could be packaged as another feature pack called the &#039;rating&#039; component? Or, combined with the slider component for even more value. 

One of the most common visual icons on the web these days would have to be the star image, frequently used on popular review websites and when booking accommodations, etc. 

It would be awesome if the user could slide the bar to the number 2 and two stars would instantly appear. And even be able to have the option to select two criteria (as you currently have this option in the slider feature pack). For example, you could select between 1.5 stars and 4 stars. If this could be done with no coding, (much like you did with the markers on maps) it would REALLY show Alpha Anywhere&#039;s true power, and run rings around FileMaker, Access, and the others.

Whenever I see a message like this, I automatically forward it to Selwyn. I was pleasantly surprised when, just a few days later, Selwyn sent me a two part series showing how this can be done.



Part One&amp;nbsp;




Part Two



When&#039;s the last time that happened when you sent an idea over to a company like Microsoft, or Oracle, or Zend, or [insert big honkin&#039; company name here]? Never! 

What are your ideas for Alpha Anywhere Version 11? Leave them here in a comment. You never know -- the next video we show might be your idea!

					Ever since I became the Director of Sniff Testing at Alpha Software, I&#039;ve received emails asking me to come out and train top dogs at other companies. This is to help them learn to execute the sniff test to ensure software quality.

But the other day, I received mail the old fashioned way. I kid you not! Here&#039;s a photo of the letter:




The letter asked for more information about my sniff test training. But since holding a pen is challenging for me (after all, I have paws), I decided to post a reply here on the blog. By the way, it&#039;s amazing what you can do with Dragon Speech! You humans might not understand me, but Dragon Speech totally understands Canine.

For sniff test training, I plan to charge two pieces of bacon and leftover pizza crust per session. Here&#039;s a look at the curriculum: 

 Wagging tail and licking product if it&#039;s ready to ship. If it&#039;s not, pushing it away with nose.
 Cleaning up after meetings by making sure no pizza is left over.
Greeting customers by opening doors via jumping up and pushing with paws. Note: accessible door handles required. 
 Providing employees with lunchtime walks in the park.
 Keeping meetings on track by barking at anything that takes you off task.


Interested in hiring me? Leave your information in a comment below, and I&#039;ll get back to you as soon as my schedule opens up.

What takes 30 minutes? Your favorite TV show? Pizza delivery? How about building an advanced search engine? With the newest Alpha Anywhere Version 11 feature pack, Power Search for Grids, you can cut the production time for building sophisticated search functionality into your app down from months to several minutes. 

The Power Search feature pack lets you build powerful, sophisticated search components, add them to your search grid, and embed them into any dialog all in under 30 minutes. 

Take a look Kayak.com, Hotels.com, or OpenTable.com. Through their search components, they make it easy to plan trips or make reservations.

These websites all have one thing in common: sophisticated search functionality powered by search boxes, sliders, pick lists, and a results grid that presents the results. They&#039;ve also got something else in common: They would take a lot longer than 30 minutes to create using PHP, Visual Studio, .Net, Ruby, or any other web development tool.

But we&#039;ve whittled the time down to just 30 minutes. 

Want to know more? We thought you might, so we sent Selwyn in to create a series of videos that show how this is done. But remember, the features shown here will only be available to you if you have the feature pack installed. 

So, think you can 
skip one episode of your favorite sitcom, or get creative while you&#039;re waiting for that pizza?

					I hate to say I told you so. And I didn&#039;t enjoy writing this post one bit.


Alright, I enjoyed it just a bit.

OK, actually, I really loved writing it.

But you would too, if an industry icon just advocated something you&#039;ve been advocating for years.

That icon would be Jakob Nielsen, author, researcher, and usability consultant who is also a partner to another industry icon, Donald Norman. He specializes in user interfaces, particularly user-centered methodology such as web usability and design strategy.

But as far as I&#039;m concerned, I have some other names for him: the king of usability, the guru of web page usability, the usability Pope, the god of usability, the usability czar, the Grand Poobah of usability, and the chief of usability.



Alright, enough buildup for how awesome Jakob Nielsen is. The point is, his most recent article is in support of my advocacy, which is for HTML5 being the answer to a lot of the problems we&#039;re seeing in web development today. In Nielsen&#039;s recent article, &quot;Mobile Sites vs. Apps: The Coming Strategy Shift,&quot; he tells us to dump the mobile apps and make the shift to open standards.




Finally! After talking about it for years, I&#039;m in good company. (Can you tell I have a weak ego?) 

He goes on to predict a major shift in strategy for developers, so it&#039;s important that all the Alphaholics read this article. It really validates our strategy here at Alpha Anywhere, which has always had you, the developer, in mind!

					BYOD is one of the most disappointing acronyms I have ever encountered. It turns out that it stands for &quot;bring your own device&quot; to work, and is a catchphrase for the consumerization era. The reason it disappointed me was because I thought it meant &quot;bring your own dog&quot; to work, and as you all know, I&#039;m a huge advocate of that trend. 

But of course, that&#039;s not the case. And once I got past my initial disappointment, I was able to focus on the enormity of the trend. I&#039;ve been tracking it for years, and recently, Tab Times asked me to share my thoughts on what most industry experts can agree on: BYOD is on the verge of mass adoption by corporations, and the device of choice is proving to be the tablet.

But BYOD poses significant problems to the enterprise. Problems that I believe Alpha Anywhere Version 11 can help solve. Take in the article, and you&#039;ll see what I mean.

					According to Webster&#039;s dictionary, one of the definitions of a valentine is someone who &quot;expresses uncritical praise or affection.&quot; Who in your life fits that description? I know exactly who it is in mine! 

My valentine brings me the paper every morning, without tearing his favorite sections out first. He makes a fool out of himself just to see me laugh, eats whatever I give him for dinner, and never steals the remote from me. He doesn&#039;t complain that I snore at night, and is happy to move to the floor when I complain that he&#039;s snoring. 

My valentine never criticizes my appearance, job, or handiwork around the house -- he&#039;s just happy to have me around. In fact, he&#039;s content to stay by my side whether I&#039;m sick or healthy, happy or sad. Have a guess who it is?

My valentine this year is Clifton, my dog!





And I&#039;m not the only one who thinks a dog is the best sweetheart -- according to Recession Wire&#039;s recent study featuring 400 Americans, the majority stated that their pets� 
emotional support and happy-go-lucky attitude were the key to helping them 
get through tough times.

Yes, we have our husbands, wives, children, and friends, but no love is quite as special as the non-judgmental, unconditional love that our dogs have for us. So this Valentine&#039;s Day, pick up a heart-shaped bone and make a date with your biggest fan. I guarantee he won&#039;t even argue about what movie to see!

And whatever you do, please don&#039;t show this to my wife!

We announced some Alpha Anywhere news last week, but if you didn&#039;t catch the press release with all the details, I&#039;ll fill you in now: Petrodata Management Services Ltd, a West African IT data storage and management facility, is now officially our newest distribution partner, and our first exclusive distributor. Because of this partnership, Alpha products will be available to individuals, corporations, and government entities throughout Nigeria and other West African countries.

The use of technology in underdeveloped countries can help alleviate poverty and inspire societal change, and we know Petrodata can help us do that due to their long history of providing high-technology firsts to West Africa. In addition to marketing and promoting Alpha Anywhere Version 11, they&#039;ll also be offering best-of-breed training courses, seminars, and application development services.

Selwyn and I were born in South Africa, and we feel a special connection to the people of any African country. We know that we&#039;re going to meet some talented new African developers thanks to this partnership, and we&#039;re excited to be adding more countries to the list of places that Version 11 is available!

					I could have titled this blog post, &quot;Custom coding for Ajax callbacks.&quot; But I think this post is about more than JavaScript and a HTML markup. It&#039;s about negating the age-old argument that, when it comes to development platforms, one size can&#039;t fit all.

How many times have you heard that certain languages and platforms are good for advanced developers, while others are good for novices? I suppose that&#039;s true for some other RAD tools, but one of the unique things about Alpha Anywhere is that it&#039;s been engineered from day one to be easy enough for beginners to get started with, but powerful, strong, and extensible enough for professionals to use everyday. 

We just spoke with a customer who told us how fast his junior developers caught onto Alpha Anywhere. Now let me give you the other side of the story, which is about some tough questions that a seasoned developer threw at us, and how we helped him accomplish his tasks using the exact same platform, Alpha Anywhere Version 11, that the novices found so easy to use.

John Landry is the former CTO and Senior Technology VP at Lotus Development and a former VP of Technology Strategy at IBM after they were acquired by IBM. He&#039;s also a developer, and was trying to execute code in script tags on an Ajax callback in Alpha Anywhere Version 11. He contacted Selwyn, and we took to the screen to create a comprehensive video tutorial, just like our Alpha Anywhere Version 11 feature peeks, to help him solve the problem. 

John was building a content management system, the contents of which were stored in a SQL database, and displaying the content using the grid component.

As you might know, a typical field of data in the SQL database contains HTML markup. But with John&#039;s project, there was a critical additional piece of information: There were script tags that contained Javascript within the HTML markup.

By setting the appropriate filters and then opening the grid on an Ajax callback, the page was able to show dynamic content stored in the database. However, even though the HTML content stored in the database was being shown, the code in the script tags was not being executed. So we told John that the reason for this was that the code in the script tags was being ignored on an Ajax callback.


Got all that? Take a look now at the video below to see the solution that worked for John. Hint: it only took one line of jQuery code.






John&#039;s experience is the perfect example of how Version 11 provides productivity for your development team, but won&#039;t hold you back when it&#039;s time for some serious coding. John was able to sink his teeth into this like Clifton into a bone, and we were happy to hear that both the project, and John&#039;s appetite for code, were satisfied!

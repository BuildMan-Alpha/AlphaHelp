	<description>The comma_to_crlf function does not take into account quoted delimiters. For example if your input string is:
alpha,beta,"gamma has, a comma",delta

 then it will blindly break the string on all of the commas, regardless of whether the string is inside a quoted delimiter.
 Here is how to implement comma_to_crlf while honoring delimiters.</description>
	<example><![CDATA[txt = <<%str%
,,abc,123,"this string,has a comma",,,98767,
%str%

txt2 = comma_to_crlf_honor_delimiters(txt)
showvar(txt2)

function comma_to_crlf_honor_delimiters as c (txt as c )
dim s as stringscanner
dim tokens[0] as c
s = s.Create(txt)
s.SkipOverWhitespace()
WHILE .t.
	dim token as c
	dim num as n = s.SkipOverCharacter(",")
	IF num > 0 THEN
		token = " "
		tokens[] = token
		FOR x = 2 TO num
			token = " "
			tokens[] = token
		next
	ELSE
		token = s.ScanOverToken("*")
		tokens[] = token
		s.SkipOverWhitespace()
		num = s.SkipOverCharacter(",")
		IF num < 1 THEN
			exit while
		ELSE
			FOR x = 2 TO num
				token = " "
				tokens[] = token
			next
		END IF
	END IF
	s.SkipOverWhitespace()
END WHILE
dim txt2 as c 
txt2 = tokens.dump()
comma_to_crlf_honor_delimiters = txt2
end function]]></example>

WorldPay is one of the world's leading payment companies. The WorldPay integration within Alpha Anywhere allows developers to process credit card and ACH transactions easily through WorldPay. You will need to setup a WorldPay merchant account to get started. See Alpha Anywhere / WorldPay Info 

Before using the WorldPayAPI::SoapActions class you will need to make note of your WorldPay account Id, account subid( if any) and merchant pin. If you are testing with a sandboxed WorldPay developer account, you will also need to provide the test credit card information that will be provided by WorldPay.

	<description>The Application Server allows for an alternate configuration file to be specified. This is done through the use of a command line option, CONFIGFILE. For example, to launch the Application Server using a configuration file named TestConfig.xml in the root of the server's C drive:</description>
	<example><![CDATA[A5ApplicationServer.exe -CONFIGFILE="C:\TestConfig.xml"]]></example>
	
</section>

	<description>A command line such as this example could be run from a command prompt directly, saved as a shortcut, or used with third-party tools that launch and/or manage programs.

If the specified configuration file is not found, a warning will be displayed and startup will be aborted. To create a new configuration file, you may either create a new, empty file which the Application Server will then populate with defaults, or you may make a copy of an existing configuration file, start the Application Server, and then modify settings as desired.
</description>
	<note>CONFIGFILE is only supported by the Application Server (A5ApplicationServer.exe). If specified when starting Alpha Five (Alpha5.exe), it will be ignored. The Alpha Five server configuration file cannot be changed.</note>

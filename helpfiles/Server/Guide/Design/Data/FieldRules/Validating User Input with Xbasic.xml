	<topic>Validating User Input with Xbasic</topic>
			<description>Frequently you will wish to force a user's input to a form field to be non-blank, within a range, or one of several values. You can achieve these effects with Field Rules, but you can also code them with Xbasic.</description>

			<description>The following code attached to the CanDepart event of the Email text field reminds the user to enter a non-blank value.</description>
			<example><![CDATA[if (alltrim(Email.text) = "") then

end if]]></example>

			<description>This code attached to the CanDepart event of the quantity field checks that the value is within the range 1 to 100.</description>
			<example><![CDATA[if alltrim( quantity.text? < 1) .or. alltrim( quantity.text? > 100) then
    ui_msg_box("Invalid Value", "The value entered must be between 1 and 100")
    cancel()
end if]]></example>

			<description>This code attached to the CanDepart event of the name field checks that the value is contained within a pre-determined list. This technique might be used as a low-level security mechanism. Most users would find a list box more friendly.</description>
			<example><![CDATA[dim list as C
list=<<%str%
George
John
Paul
Ringo
%str%
if (word_occurs(list, name.text, crlf()) = 0) then
    ui_beep()
    ui_msg_box("Wrong!", "Pick another name")
    cancel()
end if ]]></example>

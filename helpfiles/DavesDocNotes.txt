Getting Started
If you are new to Alpha Anywhere, read the Architectural Overview section (below) to get
a high level view of what Alpha Anywhere does and how it operates. If you are not 
new to Alpha Anywhere or have used its predecessor, Alpha Five, you may want to skip ahead
to the section How to Use This Help System. 


Technical Overview
Alpha Anywhere allows developers of varying skill sets, to create and deploy business
applications for mobile devices and desktop/web. 


Architecture of Applications Built with Alpha Anywhere
Alpha Anywhere applications consist of a client part and a server part. The client part 
runs on Desktop/Web browser or on a mobile device. The server part is run using 
the Alpha Anywhere Application Server, which runs on a Windows Server. 


On the client side, the applications use HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript code,
and in the case of mobile devices, you can also use native code, to access
hardware - like the camera, flashlight, and calendar. This native mobile
code is created using PhoneGap Build, which is integrated with the software.

On the server side, applications can run Xbasic, Server-side Javascript 
(Node.JS), and .Net assemblies written in any .NET supported language. 


Architecture of Alpha Anywhere
Alpha Anywhere consists of a development IDE and a server.

The server allows applications to "call back" to run server side code. Some
examples of server-side code include exchanging data with a SQL database or web service,
running a report, or sending a batch of email messages.

There are 3 variations of the server. The first is the Development Server, which is 
included in the development IDE. It's used for testing when you build you applications.

The other two variations are the Alpha Anywhere Application Server and the 
Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS. You can use either one of these servers 
when your application is deployed. All versions of the Alpha Application Server 
run on Windows. (There is currently no Mac or Linux version available.)

The development IDE is called the Alpha Anywhere Developer,
which you use to build your applications. Like the application server, this is also Windows-
based. However, many developers use a Mac and run either developer on a virtual machine
either on their Mac or an server using remote desktop. 


How to Use This Help System
The collection of pages found here at alphasoftware.com/documentation
is currently the most complete source of written documentation available, including 
information from the Alpha Anywhere Online Help System (built into the product), 
and the Alpha Five Wiki (which is no longer updated).


The Table of Contents on the left is designed to be used as a shortcut to the commonly used 
resources. It does not contain links to every page in this documentation system. 

If you don't find what you need in the Table of Contents, use the Search Box to  
search through the roughly 5,000 pages found in the help system. 

In addition to written documentation, there are over thousands of reference and tutorial
videos available on line in a searchable database at alphasoftware.com/video library



Beginner's Tutorials

Developers who want to use Alpha Anywhere are encouraged to start the tutorials, which 
take you step by step though the development environment to build some simple applications.
Below are links to three applications, and it is suggested that you complete them in 
order. 


Tutorial 1: Hello World Application

Tutorial 2: List of Editable Data with Master/Detail View

Tutorial 3: Photo App Tutorial 



---------------------------
---------------------------
Tutorial 1: Hello World Application

The point of any "hello world" type of tutorial is to show a beginner how to 
perform a simple task, so that they get a feel for how to interact with a
programming language or development environment. The task is usually to 
display "Hello World" on the screen. 

This Hello World example takes the idea a bit further, and shows you how to 
build a mobile application that has a button on its opening screen. When you 
press the button, another screen opens with the text "Hello World." There 
is then another button to take you back. 

This Application is in the form of a 7m30s video, which you can find here:
http://www.viddler.com/v/8cc19860

You can download the completed application here:
https://github.com/alphaanywhere/AlphaAnywhereSimpleHelloWorld



----------------------------------
----------------------------------
Tutorial 2: List of Editable Data with Master/Detail View

Once you've completed the Hello World tutorial, this tutorial shows 
you how to build another two-panel mobile application. This time, the 
first screen shows a list of customers from a sample SQL database. When 
you click on a customer, a detail screen appears in which you 
view and can edit details about a particular customer.


This application is in the form of a 36m recorded webinar workshop, which you can find here:
http://www.viddler.com/v/9977e8df

You can download the completed application here:
https://github.com/alphaanywhere/MasterDetail



-----------------------------------
-----------------------------------
Tutorial 3: Photo App Tutorial

This tutorial is more ambitious than the Hello World
and Master/Detail tutorials. In this tutorial, you will 
build a real application over the course of about 90 minutes.

You begin the tutorial by setting up a SQL table, which you then use to build a 
browser application. The application is then further built to work on a mobile 
device, and to access a phone camera. 

The pace is slow enough so that you can build the 
application along with the video, without needing to stop and rewind. If you have a 
second monitor, or a tablet, we suggest that you view the video on that while following 
along in Alpha Anywhere to build the application.

You can find the tutorial here:

Data Integration
Alpha Anywhere applications can perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) data operations 
directly with several different categories of data sources, including:

 - SQL Databases
 - Web Services
 - NoSQL Databases
 - Files

Alpha Anywhere applications can also integrate data from multiple sources at the same time,
helpful for creating reports, dashboards, and other business intelligence solutions.  

Connections are typically made using Connection Strings.


Connection Strings
		When building your application, connections to data sources are made using 
		connection strings, which are collections of settings including the type and 
		location of the database and the account credentials. 

		A connection string can be created dynamically when the application is run using 
		Xbasic, but usually it is created ahead of time using the Connection String
		Dialog box.  
		
		http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Server/Guide/Design/Data/SQL/Create%20SQL%20Connection%20String%20Dialog.html 



SQL Databases
	Alpha Anywhere includes native drivers for  popular and enterprise back end SQL systems.
	This includes Microsoft Access, SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, DB2 and many others. This 
	allows you to connect to data you are already using in another system,
	without disrupting the other system. For example, if you had a web application 
	written in Ruby or a desktop application in MS Access, you could leave that system in 
	place and create a mobile application that shares data with the legacy system.
		
	Using SQL with Xbasic
		Xbasic includes an connection object and functions for working with SQL.
		For details on using these, refer to the Learning Xbasic with SQL
		tutorial.
		http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Desktop/Guide/Design/Platform/Xbasic/Learning%20Xbasic%20-%20Using%20Xbasic%20with%20SQL%20Tables.html
	
	SQL Tools
		Alpha Anywhere includes a collection of tools for working with SQL databases.
		These include:
			
			The Database Explorer - for viewing the structure of database, the structure 
			of its tables and views, as well as statistics and a preview of its data.
			http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Desktop/Guide/Design/Data/DBF/Database%20Explorer.html
			
			SQL Query Genie - The SQL Query Genie is point and click tool for creating
			and testing SQL statements. 
			http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Desktop/Guide/Design/Data/SQL/SQL%20Genie.html
			
			SQL Command Window - The SQL Command Window lets you type or paste SQL commands
			and then execute them against a backend SQL database.
			http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Server/Guide/Design/Data/SQL/SQL%20Command%20Window.html
			
			Portable SQL -  Alpha Anywhere has its own, generic version of the SQL language,
			called Portable SQL, which is generated for you when you use the SQL Querie
			Genie and other tools. Before connecting to a database, Alpha automatically 
			translates Portable SQL to the correct native format for the SQL backend you are 
			using. Information about the syntax of Portable SQL can be found here:
			http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Server/Guide/Design/Data/SQL/Supported%20Portable%20SQL%20Syntax.html
			
			Flying Start Genie - The Flying Start Genie automatically builds a simple
			web application using the structure of a SQL database. You can then 
			modify the application to suit your needs.
			http://news.alphasoftware.com/V10Preview/FeaturePacks/FeaturePack_FlyingStart.html
			
			
			
		
Web Services
	In addition to SQL backends, you can also use web services as a data source.
	If the web service you want to use follows the OData protocol, Alpha has connector 
	that you can use to build a connection string to the OData service. If the web 
	service uses another protocol, you may need to write (or acquire) a custom connector.
	
	
	
	OData 
	Alpha Anywhere includes a connector for OData data sources, which you can select 
	when you create a connection string. (See connection strings)
	
	An example of OData in use with Alpha Anywhere can be found in this video:   	
	http://www.viddler.com/v/66c0a1f?secret=66617726
	
	Custom Connectors
		XML Tools
		JSON Tools

Input 
	This section deals with how to add new data to an Alpha Anywhere application.
	


	Text and Numbers - Alpha can capture text, numbers, and special characters from
	a keyboard or from a virtual keyboard (like the iPhone keyboard). It is also 
	possible to create customized virtual keyboards to make data entry more efficient.

	Images - Alpha can generate the code you need to capture images or select and 
	upload images from a web application or a mobile device. 
	
			
	Importing Data Files - Alpha can import data from CSV files, MS Access Files,
	MS Excel files, and other types of files. You can also write a custom routine 
	to import data from virtually any type of file. 

	Documents - Documents in PDF, TIFF, or any other format can be saved as individual
	files on a server, in a database, or on the cloud via a web service.

	Audio and Video - Alpha Anywhere applications can capture audio and video from 
	the client device. Files can be saved on the local device, individually on the server
	or to a	cloud service. 

	GPS and Maps - Geographical information can be captured by accessing the GPS
	system of the client device. It can also be captured by dragging markers on a map.
	
	Digital Ink	- You can capture notes	and drawing entered on touch screen by 
	a finger or stylus. The imported is stored as a scalable vector graphic, which 
	can be edited.
	
	Signature Capture - Signature capture is a digital ink control designed to 
	allow someone to sign their name using a finger or stylus.

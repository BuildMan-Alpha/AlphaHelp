    <description>Learn how to build a Master Detail using the List and FormView Controls in a UX Component. The List and FormView controls allow you to create a light-weight application that can be deployed in either the web or mobile environment. In this tutorial, we demonstrate creating a Master-Detail mobile application that takes advantage of several features, including Editors and the ControlBar, to create an easy-to-use responsive interface.</description>

                        <p>In this video tutorial, we show how implement a Master-Detail application using the FormView control. The app allows users to edit data from the Customers and Orders table in the sample Northwind database. This is a classic Master-Detail form: Each customer has multiple orders. The UX component uses two Lists joined in a parent-child relationship. The parent List displays data from the Customer table and the child List display the related orders from the Orders table.</p>
                        <p>Each List has a Detail View, but in both cases, the Detail View is implemented using the FormView control.</p>
                        <p>Once we are done building the basic functionality, we 'mobilize' the app by wrapping sections of the component in PanelCards and add a ControlBar to provide the ability to navigate the application.</p>

                        <p>To follow along with this tutorial, you will need a connection string to the Northwind database. Alpha Anywhere ships with a pre-defined connection string to the Northwind database called 'AADemo-Northwind'.</p>

                        <p>If you'd prefer to follow along, you can [Download the Components] used in the videos. These components can be used to follow along with the tutorial or as a starting point for your own Master-Detail application.</p>
                        <p>When you run the components in Working or Live Preview, you may see the following error:</p>

                    <description>The components in the download require two connection strings, one named "northwind" and the other named "mysql_northwind". The easiest way to create these connection strings is to copy the 'AADemo-Northwind' connection string. The 'AADemo-Northwind' connection is a connection string that connects to the Northwind LocalDB database that ships with Alpha Anywhere.</description>

    <description>In this 90 minute video, Dan Bricklin walks you through the process of building a web and mobile application that can capture and store images in a SQL database.</description>

        <p>The tutorial begins the course by setting up a SQL table, which you then use to build a browser application. The application is then further built to work on a mobile device and access a phone camera.</p>
        <p>The pace is slow enough so that you can build the application along with the video, without needing to stop and rewind. If you have a second monitor or tablet, we suggest that you view the video on that while following along in Alpha Anywhere to build the application.</p>

                <p>You begin the course by setting up a SQL table, which you then use to build a browser application. The application is then further built to work on a mobile device, and to access a phone camera. The pace is slow enough so that you can build the application along with the video, without needing to stop and rewind. If you have a second monitor, or a tablet, we suggest that you view the video on that while following along in Alpha Anywhere to build the application.</p>

                        <p>After you have installed and registered Alpha Anywhere, you are ready to begin building your first application. Choose one of the tutorials below to start building your first Web or Mobile Application.</p>
                        <p>Our Getting Started Tutorials are broken into two tracks: Mobile and Web. If you need to build applications that will be used in the field and need to work with or without an internet connection, start with our [Build Your First Mobile App] tutorial. If your users will always have a network connection and typically work on a laptop or desktop computer, start with our [Build Your First Web App] tutorial.</p>

                    <description>
                        <p>Web applications and support files for mobile applications are deployed in Alpha Anywhere using a process called "Publishing". When an application is "published", all of the files required to run and view the application online are compiled and uploaded to the Alpha Anywhere Application Server.</p>
                        <p>There are multiple deployment options available for publishing a web application. The publishing method you should use depends on which Alpha Anywhere Application Server you are running (IIS or Standard.) </p>

                                <p>[Publishing to a Remote Server running the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS] - The Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS offers many benefits over the stand-alone Application Server. If you are using the Application Server for IIS, you must use an IIS Publish profile to deploy your application, which utilizes the Web Deploy service in IIS to publish your application. The [IIS Getting Started Guide] walks you through setting up and configuring IIS for deploying applications.</p>

                                <p>[Publishing to a Remote Server over HTTP/HTTPS] - HTTP Publishing utilizes the Alpha Anywhere Application Server to upload the files for your application. Since publishing is done over the HTTP (or HTTPS) protocol, no additional ports or third-part applications are required. Simply configure your Alpha Anywhere Application Server to allow HTTP publish and upload you application. This step-by-step tutorial explains how to configure and publish an application to the Application Server using HTTP Publish.</p>

    <description>A step-by-step guide to configuring the Alpha Anywhere Application Server and publishing profile to publish your Alpha Anywhere Application using HTTP publish.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>This tutorial describes how to configure the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for HTTP publishing and how to create the corresponding publishing profile to publish a web application using HTTP Publish.</p>
        <p>If want to publish an application to a server running the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS, you must use the instructions described in [Publishing to IIS]. For Alpha Cloud, see [Publishing to Alpha Cloud].</p>

            <description>
                <p>Before you can create an HTTP Publishing profile, the Alpha Anywhere Application Server must first be configured to allow HTTP Publishing. This section requires that the Alpha Anywhere Application Server is installed on the server and that you have access to modify the server's settings.</p>
                <p>These instructions can also be used to configure the Development Server to allow HTTP publishing.</p>
                <p>For additional details, watch the video "Configuring the Web Application Server for HTTP Publish" listed in [Appendix B: Videos].</p>

                        <p>Open the Server Settings.</p>
                        <p>If you are using the development server, open the Development Server Settings. In the Alpha Anywhere Development environment, navigate to the *[ui:Web Projects Control Panel]*. Open the *[ui:Web]* menu and select *[ui:Development Server]*.</p>
                        <p>If you are using the Alpha Anywhere Application Server, launch the Application Server if it is not already running. Then, double-click the system tray icon to open the Server Settings dialog. Alternatively, you can right-click the system tray icon and select *[ui:Configure Server]* from the context menu to open the Server Settings.</p>

            <description>The Publishing Profile describes where web application files will be published in the Application Server's webroot, either locally or on a server. During the publishing process, the project files for the web application are compiled and copied to the webroot for the Application Server.

            <description>
                <p>To view your published application, open the web browser and type in the address for a page that was published. The address is a combination of the Base URL and page name.</p>
                <p>The Base URL for an application published using HTTP Publish is a combination of the *[ui:Server URL]* and the *[ui:Target Folder]*.</p>
                <p>For example, if the *[ui:Server URL]* is *[bold:http://www.myapp.com]* and the web project was published to a *[ui:Target Folder]* called *[app1]* in the webroot, the Base URL for the published application would be:</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[http://www.myapp.com/app1]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p>If the target web server doesn't use port 80 (http) or 443 (https), you must also remember to include the port number (which should already be included in the *[ui:Server URL]* for the HTTP Publish profile.) The image below is an example of a *[ui:Server URL]* that contains a port number.</p>
                <p>The configuration shown is for connecting to the Development server for HTTP publishing. The Development server is configured to listen on port 8080. The *[ui:Server URL]* for connecting to the Development server is *[bold:http://localhost:8080]*.</p>
                <p>The HTTP publishing configuration also includes a *[ui:Target Folder]*, *[HttpPublishTest]*.</p>
            </description>

        <section>
            <description>Both the *[ui:Server URL]* and *[ui:Target Folder]* are combined to form the Base URL for the application: *[http://localhost:8080/HttpPublishTest]*. Using the Base URL, you can access the pages published to the server from a web browser. For example, if you wanted to view the published "testPage.a5w" for the web application, you would open a web browser and type the following into the address bar:</description>
            <example><![CDATA[http://localhost:8080/HttpPublishTest/testPage.a5w]]></example>

            <description>You can also specify a page open in the default web browser after publishing completes in the *[ui:Publish Web Project]* dialog.

                        <p>These tutorials were built using the full Alpha Anywhere Development Environment. Some tutorials may not apply due to features that are not available in Community Edition. Community Edition users may encounter screens that don't match their environment due to differences between the two development environments.</p>
                        <p>We strongly recommend starting with the tutorials in the *[extlink:Alpha Software Learning Center@https://learn.alphasoftware.com]* to start learning Alpha Anywhere.</p>

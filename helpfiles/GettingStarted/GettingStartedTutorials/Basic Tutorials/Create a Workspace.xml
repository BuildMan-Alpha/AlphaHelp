                        <p>This tutorial was built using the full Alpha Anywhere Development Environment. Community Edition users may encounter screens that don't match their environment due to differences between the two development environments.</p>
                        <p>We strongly recommend starting with the tutorials in the *[extlink:Alpha Software Learning Center@https://learn.alphasoftware.com]* to start learning Alpha Anywhere.</p>

                To create a new mobile or web application with Alpha Anywhere, you must create a new workspace. A workspace contains all files your application needs, including files such as components, javascript libraries, images, HTML pages, .a5w pages, and css style sheets. Let's create a new, blank Alpha Anywhere workspace.

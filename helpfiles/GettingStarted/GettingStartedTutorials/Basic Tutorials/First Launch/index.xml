            <title>Create a New Workspace</title>
            <description>Since this is your first time launching Alpha Anywhere, you will need to create a new Workspace before you can start building applications with Alpha Anywhere. A workspace will contain all files your application needs, including components, javascript libraries, images, HTML pages, .a5w pages, and css style sheets. Creating a new workspace can be done using the *[ui:Create a new, empty Workspace]* option.</description>
            <steps>

                    <description>Click the *[ui:Create a new, empty Workspace]*  and then click the *[ui:OK]* button to create a new workspace.</description>

                    <description>Create a new directory. This directory is where you will save your project. A good naming convention for Alpha Anywhere projects is to give the workspace the same name as its parent directory. For example, if you're new workspace will be named "HelloAlpha", then the directory should also be named "HelloAlpha".</description>

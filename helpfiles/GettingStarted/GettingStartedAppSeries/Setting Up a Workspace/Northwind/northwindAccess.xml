    <description>A step-by-step tutorial on setting up the Northwind Access database so it can be used by components in Alpha Anywhere.</description>
    <discussion>The Northwind database is a Microsoft Access database that ships with Alpha Anywhere. In order to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the Northwind Access database, the database must be copied to a directory where you have read/write access or converted to another database format. The Northwind Access database can be found inside the *[MDBFiles]* directory in your Alpha Anyhwere installation. Your Alpha Anyhwere install is typically located at *[bold:C:\Program Files (x86)\a5v12]*.</discussion>

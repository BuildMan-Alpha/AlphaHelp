    <description>A step-by-step guild to testing an Alpha Anywhere mobile or web applictaion using Working Preview and Live Preview.</description>
    <discussion>Alpha Anywhere's development environment includes tools for previewing a component: Working Preview and Live Preview. Working and Live Preview allow you to test a component before publshing it locally, to a web server, or deployed as a PhoneGap application.</discussion>

                    <description>Working Preview has several limitations. If your component contains Javascript events that open an Alpha Anywhere report or .a5w page in a popup window or DIV on the page, you cannot test these actions in Working Preview. Working Preview also does not have access to the Application Server objects, such as *[xb:session]* or *[xb:request]*. If you need to test features that require the Application Server, create reports, or display .a5w pages, you need to perform a Live Preview.</description>

                    <description>
                        <p>Live Preview is similar to Working Preview in that allows you to preview and test a component in Alpha Anywhere. While Working Preview allows you to test many aspects of a Component, Working Preview lacks the ability to open any reports or .a5w pages. You also cannot test any code that references xbasic server variables, including the session and request objects.</p>
                        <p>Live Preview renders the component using the Alpha Anywhere Application Development Server. This gives you access to Reports as well as the ability to open external .a5w pages and test xbasic code that uses server variables. You can also do limited testing of controls with security restrictions set using *[ui:Security Groups]*.</p>
                        <p>The Live Preview is rendered using the Internet Explorer web browser. You are not limited to using Internet Explorer to perform a Live Preview. You can optionally launch the component in a browser of your choice using the dropdown menu in the toolbar or by clicking one of the browsers listed at the bottom of Live Preview (shown below).</p>

                    <note>While you do have access to some server objects (session, request), Live Preview has several limitations that you cannot overcome. </note>

                    <description>
                        <p>When you Live Preview a Component, you will be asked what type of Live Preview you wish to perform: *[ui:Full Preview]* or *[ui:Fast Preview]*.</p>
                        <p>The Component is published to a special directory called "Live Preview" in the webroot when you perform a Live Preview. In this "Live Preview" directory includes the Component but all of the resources required to render the component, including external CSS and Javascript files, images, web fonts, other components referenced by the Component, and other resources required by the Component. In order for these files to be published, however, a *[ui:Full Preview]* is required. If there are a large number of resources, it can take a few moments for the *[ui:Full Preview]* to publish the files needed to perform a Live Preview of the Component.</p>
                        <p>Once all resources the Component requires have been initially published, the publishing step can be skipped using *[ui:Fast Preview]*. When a *[ui:Fast Preview]* is perfomed, only the Component is published to the "Live Preview" directory.</p>
                        <p>If you make changes to the Component's referenced resources, a *[ui:Full Preview]* is required so the new resources will be published to the "Live Preview" directory.</p>
                    </description>
                    <note>The default webroot location is *[bold:C:/A5Webroot]*. The webroot can be changed in the Development Server Settings. From the *[ui:Web Projects Control Panel]*, click on the *[ui:Web]* menu and select *[ui:Development Server]*. The *[ui:Document Root]* property on the *[ui:General]* tab defines the webroot.</note>

                                <p>If the Development Server is not running, you will be prompted to turn it on. The Develpoment Server must be running in order to preview a component using Live Preview. If you are prompted to turn on the Development Server, you will have three options: "Yes", "No - Cancel Preview", and "No - Continue with Preview - I already have a server running in another instance". If you have multiple instances of Alpha Anyhwere running, you can perform a Live Preview without starting the Development Server if the server was already started by another Alpha Anyhwere instance.</p>
                                <p>Select *[ui:Yes]* and click *[ui:OK]* to start the Development Server.</p>
                            </description>
                            <note>If you have never configured the Development Server, you may receive an error message stating "Port 80 is already in use." Follow the instructions outlined in *[link:]* to configure the Development Server on your system before proceeding futher. See also *[extlink:Port is Already in Use Error when Starting Server]* for more information about resolving Port in use issues.</note>

                    <description>Live Preview allows you to preview a component in a live web page using the Alpha Anyhwere Application Server. The preview is rendered in Alpha Anywhere using Internet Explorer. You are not limited to using Internet Explorer to perform a Live Preview. You can launch the component in a browser of your choice using the dropdown menu in the toolbar. Select the browser you wish to use. Alpha Anywhere will create a temporary web page for rendering the component and open it in the selected browser.</description>

                    <description>
                        <p>When you Live Preview a Component, you will be asked what type of Live Preview you wish to perform: *[ui:Full Preview]* or *[ui:Fast Preview]*.</p>
                        <p>The Component is published to a special directory called "Live Preview" in the webroot when you perform a Live Preview. In this "Live Preview" directory includes the Component but all of the resources required to render the component, including external CSS and Javascript files, images, web fonts, other components referenced by the Component, and other resources required by the Component. In order for these files to be published, however, a *[ui:Full Preview]* is required. If there are a large number of resources, it can take a few moments for the *[ui:Full Preview]* to publish the files needed to perform a Live Preview of the Component.</p>
                        <p>Once all resources the Component requires have been initially published, the publishing step can be skipped using *[ui:Fast Preview]*. When a *[ui:Fast Preview]* is perfomed, only the Component is published to the "Live Preview" directory.</p>
                        <p>If you make changes to the Component's referenced resources, a *[ui:Full Preview]* is required so the new resources will be published to the "Live Preview" directory.</p>
                    </description>
                    <note>The default webroot location is *[bold:C:/A5Webroot]*. The webroot can be changed in the Development Server Settings. From the *[ui:Web Projects Control Panel]*, click on the *[ui:Web]* menu and select *[ui:Development Server]*. The *[ui:Document Root]* property on *[ui:General]* tab defines the webroot.</note>

                                <p>If the Development Server is not running, you will be prompted to turn it on. The Develpoment Server must be running in order to preview a component using Live Preview. If you are prompted to turn on the Development Server, you will have three options: "Yes", "No - Cancel Preview", and "No - Continue with Preview - I already have a server running in another instance". If you have multiple instances of Alpha Anyhwere running, you can perform a Live Preview without starting the Development Server if the server was already started by another Alpha Anyhwere instance.</p>
                                <p>Select *[ui:Yes]* and click *[ui:OK]* to start the Development Server.</p>
                            </description>
                            <note>If you have never configured the Development Server, you may receive an error message stating "Port 80 is already in use." Follow the instructions outlined in *[link:]* to configure the Development Server on your system before proceeding futher. See also *[extlink:Port is Already in Use Error when Starting Server]* for more information about Port in use errors and how to fix them.</note>

<h1>Alpha Anywhere Technical Overview</h1>

<p>


	<p>Alpha Anywhere is a platform for developers of varying skill sets, to create and deploy business
		applications for mobile devices and desktop/web. The platform itself, has 
		two parts: the <b>Alpha Anywhere Developer</b> for building applications and the 
		<b>Alpha Anywhere Application Server</b> for deploying applications built by the Developer. 
	
</p>		
		
		<h2>Alpha Anywhere Developer (IDE)</h2>
<p>
		Applications are created using the Alpha Anywhere Developer, a 
		point-and-click type of IDE interface. One of the primary benefits of the 
		Alpha Anywhere Developer is that it writes much of the code for you, but still
		allows you to add your own custom code when necessary. It also is tightly 
		integrated with the Alpha Anywhere Application Server - so you can create 
		the code for both the client-side device and the server all in one place.
<br/><br/>
		The developer is a Windows-based, and requires Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 
		or above. It can also be run on a Mac under parallels, and it can be used 
		over Remote Desktop, allowing you to build applications on a PC, Mac, or Chromebook.
</p>


		<h2>Alpha Anywhere Application Server</h2>
<p>
		The Alpha Anywhere Application Server serves two roles in deploying applications.
		First, in the case of web applications, the server allows the applications you have written 
		to you to access your web application on a web browser by typing in a URL or 
		IP address. 
<br/><br/>
		Second, in the case of mobile applications, the server allows the application to 
		make RESTful calls to exchange data or run server side code. 
<br/><br/>
		The server software is Windows based, and requires Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 
		or above. Alpha Anywhere hosting, including cloud hosting is available from third parties,
		or the server can be self-hosted.
<br/><br/>
The server can also be run with IIS using the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS.
		
</p>

		<h2>Structure of Alpha Anywhere Applications</h2>		
<p>
		Alpha Anywhere applications are built using combination of client-side code and 
		server-side code. The client-side code is a combination of HTML5/CSS3 and JavaScript 
		code. Optionally, applications may also include PhoneGap code, which allows 
		applications to access the hardware on a mobile device, such as the 
		camera or GPS unit. 
		<br/><br/>
		Server-side code primarily uses Xbasic, Alpha Anywhere's 
		scripting language. In addition, small Xbasic stubs can be added that allow .NET
		assemblies to be used. This allows server-side code to be written in 
		virtually all major programming languages.

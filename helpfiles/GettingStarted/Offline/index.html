    <h1>Offline Data Caching, Capture, and Synchronization</h1>
    <p>
        In order for a mobile application to function when an 
        Internet connection is either unavailable or unreliable, 
        the data your application needs to function must to be 
        stored locally on the device. When signal is restored, 
        newly entered (or edited) data can then be synchronized 
        with data in the system of record.
    </p>

    <h2>How is Data Stored on a Mobile Device for Editing?</h2>
    <p>
        Alpha Anywhere can store its data on the device using 
        using one or more list controls. List controls are controls 
        that are placed on a UX component (a UX Component can be 
        thought of as a user interface form). They can be populated 
        from any kind of data source and they retain their data 
        when the device is disconnected from the Internet. While 
        disconnected they can be used to perform CRUD operations, 
        and data can be resynchronized when a signal is restored. 
        List controls require very little work to set up, but are 
        limited in size to about 5MB of data since data are stored 
        in the device's browser cache.
    </p>

    <h2>How does Synchronization Work?</h2>
    <p>
        When in offline operation, Alpha Anywhere keeps track of 
        records as they are added and updated in a List control. 
        In cases of updates, Alpha keeps track of both the newly 
        entered values and the original values. When signal is restored,
        data can be synchronized manually - say by a user pressing a 
        button - or it can be done automatically, in which the 
        application checks to see if there is an Internet connection
        and automatically syncs when one is detected. During 
        synchronization, Alpha Anywhere checks for synchronization 
        conflicts.
    </p>

    <h2>What Happens if There are Synchronization Conflicts?</h2>
    <p>
        It is possible that when a record is edited in a List control offline by one 
        person, that another person may also be editing that same 
        record creating a data conflict. Alpha Anywhere can resolve 
        these data conflicts either by allowing the user to decide 
        which value(s) to keep or by following a business rule and 
        handling the conflict automatically.
    </p>

    <h2>How Much Data Can be Stored?</h2>
    <p>
        Alpha Anywhere applications can use most of the available 
        free space on a device to store data. While the List Control 
        is limited to the 5MB of data storage space available in 
        Local Storage, read-only data can be stored in the local 
        file system. In addition, the List Control records can store 
        a variety of data captured on mobile devices on the local 
        file system in apps built using the PhoneGap framework. 
        Data stored in the local file system can be several gigabytes 
        or more, enough to store millions of records in text, thousands
        of images, and hundreds of video recordings.
    </p>

    <h3>Client-side Data Cache</h3>
    <p>
        The client-side data cache is a local repository built into 
        the UX component. Unlike the list control, data can be stored
        in the device's file system, so it is not limited to the 5MB
        limit. The client-side cache may require slightly more setup
        work than the list control, however it is a great way to 
        store read-only application data.
    </p>

    <h3>SQLite</h3>
    <p>
        Alpha Anywhere supports SQLite, a lightweight SQL-type database
        that can run locally on a mobile device. This requires more work
        to set up than the a list control or client-side data cache, 
        but it is an excellent choice when an application is required 
        to reference or quickly search a large set of records.

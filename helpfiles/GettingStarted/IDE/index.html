<h1>The Alpha Developer IDE</h1>

<p>
The Alpha Developer is the integrated development environment (IDE), in which you 
build your application. It includes code editors, automation tools for writing and 
organizing your applications, preview screens, and a debugger. The main parts of the 
IDE are listed below. 
</p>






<h2>Web Projects Control Panel</h2>

<p>The Web Projects Control Panel is the primary 
interface for working with the files and settings of your application. From this 
control panel you can launch editors to create or modify your application. You 
can preview your application, and you can publish it for deployment.

<p>Alpha Anywhere applications are built out components. Some components 
are general purpose, like the UX Component, a primary building block for mobile applications.
Some are more specific, like the Google Map component. Each component type has its 
own component builder.</p>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>Welcome to Alpha Anywhere, the Rapid Application Development platform
for building and deploying mobile, web, and desktop business applications. This Getting Started
section is aimed at people who are new to Alpha Anywhere. It provides a high-level
overview of the Alpha Anywhere platform and its key features. It also features several <a href="GettingStartedTutorials/index.xml">Getting Started Tutorials</a> that provide detailed step-by-step instructions for building your first <a href="GettingStartedTutorials/Build a Mobile App/index.xml">mobile</a> or <a href="GettingStartedTutorials/Build a Web App/index.xml">web</a> application.</p>

<h2>What is Alpha Anywhere?</h2>

<p>Alpha Anywhere is a platform for developers of varying skill sets 
to create and deploy business applications for mobile devices and 
desktop/web. The platform has two parts, a developer for building applications
and a server for deploying them. Applications can either be run in a web browser or 
they can be installed as an application on a mobile device. For more details and 
a video, see the <a href="Overview/index.html" >Alpha Anywhere Technical Overview</a> page.	
</p>


<h2>What are the Key Features?</h2>
<p>
Alpha Anywhere has a deep feature set for all aspects of application development, including 
data integration, offline support, cross-platform support, reporting, touch screen
and rich data support, security, and much more. 
</p>

<h3>Data Integration</h3>

<td>
<p>
Alpha Anywhere applications can perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations from 
virtually any data source, including SQL-type databases, NoSQL databases, and web 
services. For details, see the <a href="Data Integration/index.html" >Data Integration</a> page.
</p>

<h3>Offline Support With Synchronization</h3>
<table><tr>
<td valign="top"><img src="/documentation/pages/images/icons/wlan_antenna.png"></td> 
<td>
<p>
Alpha Anywhere includes technology that allows applications to work in an offline/disconnected
mode. When a connection is restored, the data that is entered is synched to a server. 
Applications can also store downloaded data for offline use that can be edited while offline. 
In cases of conflict, where a record is changed by two or more users, Alpha provides
a system to intelligently manage conflicts. For details, see the <a href="Offline/index.html">
Offline Data Capture and Synchronization</a> page.

<h3>Cross Platform / Cross Device Support</h3>

<td>
<p>
Because Alpha Anywhere builds HTML5/JavaScript applications, they can be run on 
practically any device that has a web browser, including desktop and laptop Mac/PCs,
smart phones, and tablets. On mobile devices, Alpha Anywhere applications can
be installed as native applications, and can access the the devices' hardware. For 
more details see the <a href="Overview/index.html" >Technical Overview</a> page.

<h3>Reporting</h3>
<table><tr>
<td valign="top"><img src="/documentation/pages/images/icons/server_document.png"></td>

Alpha Anywhere includes a banded report-writer that can create sophisticated 
reports from a variety of data sources. The reports can be generated as PDF, HTML,
Excel files and in other formats. Alpha can displayed on screen, in an application,
or they can be automatically emailed. 
</p>
</td></tr></table>


<h3>Rich User Experience</h3>
<table><tr>
<td valign="top"><img src="/documentation/pages/images/icons/graphics_tablet.png"></td>

Alpha Anywhere supports very rich user interfaces for both desktop/mobile and web applications.
Applications can include maps, charts, gauges, and special controls. There are also ink controls
for drawing on a touch screen, image annotation for making notes on pictures, a signature 
capture control, and support for all audio and video. 
</p>

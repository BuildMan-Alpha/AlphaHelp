                <description>
                    <p>When the Alpha Anywhere Security Framework is turned on, you can require a users to log into an application before they can use it. The user must provide their user id and password for their account in order to log into the application.</p>
                    <p>You can provide an option for users to log into your app using credentials from a social network, such as Facebook or Google. These alternative login options can be used to authorize an existing user as well as register new users in the Alpha Anywhere Security Framework</p>
                    <p>In this video series, we explain how to setup and configure an application to use alternative login to verify users have authorization to use your app.</p>

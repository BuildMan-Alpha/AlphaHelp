   <topic>Update, Insert or Delete data. (for use with an UNBOUND component)</topic>
   <description>Updates, inserts or deletes a record in a table using data submitted from a control on a UX component.
       The UX component need not have been 'Data Bound' in order to use this action.
       Contrast this action with the 'Save Submitted Data to Table(s)' action in Server-side action scripting which is used for saving
       data to tables in a UX component that has been 'Data Bound'.

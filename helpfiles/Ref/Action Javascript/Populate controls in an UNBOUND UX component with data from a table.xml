       Use this action (rather than the 'Populate Controls in a UX Component with data from Tables' action)
       if the UX component has not been bound to a database (see the 'Data Binding' pane in the builder).

            <description>Used with the UX component. If the specified primary key is not found in the table you can now specify that the values in the databound controls should be cleared, you can also suppress the error message, and you can call a Javascript function.
See 'Errors and No Match Found' section in the genie.</description>

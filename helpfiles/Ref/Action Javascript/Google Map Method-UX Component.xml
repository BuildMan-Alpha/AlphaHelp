           <description>An option in the 'Google Map Methods (UX Component)' action allows you to resize the map. 
               You can set the map height and width to an explicit size, or you can read the size from controls on the component, 
               or you can call a Javascript function that returns the height and width.</description>
           <note>In many cases where a Map is used in a UX that has Panels, you will set the 'Fill container' 
               property on the Map and so the map will resize automatically. You will not need this new action.</note>

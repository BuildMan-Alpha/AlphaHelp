    <discussion>
        <p>The *[ui:PhoneGap - Manifest ... (multiple actions)]* action makes it easy to download multiple files (including SQLite database files) to a device so that these files can be accessed while the application is offline.</p>

            <title>Fetch files in manifest</title>
            <description>
                <p>The *[ui:Fetch files in a manifest]* action downloads one or more files at a location specified by a manifest. The manifest can be defined at design time as a JSON array or downloaded from a URL.</p>
                <p>The properties for this action include:</p>
            </description>
            <cases>
                <case>
                    <title nested="2">Manifest type</title>
                    <description>
                        <p>The *[ui:Manifest type]* defines how the manifest is provided. It can either be a static JSON array that defines the files to download or a URL where the manifest can be found.</p>
                    </description>
                </case>
                <case>
                    <title nested="2">Manifest JSON</title>
                    <description>
                        <p>If the *[ui:Manifest type]* is "JSON", then you must set this property. The Manifest JSON is a JSON array containing a list of objects with the following properties:</p>
                        <p>
                            <list>
                                <item>
                                    <name>url</name>
                                    <description>The URL where the file can be downloaded.</description>
                                </item>
                                <item>
                                    <name>type</name>
                                    <description>The file type. This can be "sqlite", "folder", or "file".</description>
                                </item>
                                <item>
                                    <name>targetFolder</name>
                                    <description>The location to save the file on the mobile device's filesystem. This property does not apply to SQLite files, which are always stored in a special location using the *[ui:Manifest folder]* name and *[ui:three underscores]* as a prefix on the SQLite database file. For example, *[json:folder___db1.db]*.</description>
                                </item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>If *[json:type]* is set to "folder", the folder *[must]* be zipped into a single file.</p>
                        <p>If *[json:type]* is set to "sqlite", the file *[must]* either have a *[ui:.db]* extension or be a zipped archive containing one or more SQLite databases (which must have the *[ui:.db]* extension.)</p>
                        <p>If you are downloading SQLite database files, it is recommended that these files are zipped to minimize the amount of data to download.</p>
                        <p>The example JSON below is a manifest file that demonstrates how to define each *[json:type]*:</p>

                    <description>If the *[ui:Manifest type]* is set to "URL", you must specify the URL where the manifest can be found. The manifest must use the same JSON array format as the one used for the *[ui:Manifest JSON]* property above.</description>

                    <description>Specify options, such as whether progress should be displayed while the manifest files are downloaded. For example:</description>

    progress: {
        color: 'pink',

                <case>
                    <title nested="2">File system part</title>
                    <description>Defines where in the file system the manifest should be downloaded. The *[ui:File system part]* can be "temp", "private", "saved", "public", or "persistent".</description>

                <case>
                    <title nested="2">On complete javascript</title>
                    <description>
                        <p>When the operation completes, the *[ui:On complete javascript]* event is triggered.</p>
                        <p>You can specify JavaScript in this event to process the result of the action, including checking to see if any errors occurred while files were being fetched.</p>
                        <p>Your code can reference an object called *[js:obj]*. This object has these properties:</p>

                            <list>

            <description>
                <p>The *[ui:List manifest files on device]* action gets a list of the manifest files that were saved to the device. This list is returned as a JavaScript array that is passed to the *[ui:onComplete]* event where you can write your own JavaScript to process the information.</p>

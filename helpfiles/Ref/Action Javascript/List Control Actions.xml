            <title>Refresh Data</title>
            <description>
                <p>Perform an Ajax Callback to the server to refresh the data in the List.</p>
            </description>
            <note>This action is only meaningful if the List was populated with data that was computed on the server. For example, if the List data source is *[ui:SQL]*, *[ui:DBF]*, *[ui:Custom]*, etc. If the List data source is set to *[ui:Javascript function]*, then this action is meaningless.</note>

            <title>Refresh Cascading Lists</title>
            <description>
                <p>Perform an Ajax Callback to refresh the data in the child List(s) for a particular List.</p>
                <p>For example, the current List might show a list of Customers. This List might have a child List that shows Orders, and the Orders List might have a child List that shows OrderDetails. If you perform this action on the Customers List, it will update the data in the Orders List and the OrderDetails List.</p>

            <note>This action is only meaningful if the List was populated with data that was computed on the server and if *[ui:pagination]* was turned on in the List definition and the pagination method is set to *[ui:NavigationButtons]*.

        <description>After the export file has been created you can either download the file to the client, or call an Xbasic function to further process the exported file. A typical use case where you might want to call an Xbasic function to process the exported file would be if you wanted to email the file to a list of recipients, or upload the file to cloud storage, such as Amazon S3 storage.
    In the case where the List is based on a SQL query you have the option of:

        </case>
        
        </cases>
    </section>
    <section>
        <description>Consider the case where you have defined a List and have turned on the pagination feature. You might have set the page size to 100 rows. The query that the List is based on might have 1,000 records, but the List will only show 100 rows of data at a time. If the export is based on the 'Data in the List' the export file will have 100 rows in it (because the List only has one page of data - 100 rows - in memory at any time). However, if the export is based on 'Data in the List Query' the export file will have 1,000 rows in it (subject to the Max Records setting which might limit the number of rows in the export file).
    To export data in a List you can use Action Javascript to define the code.

    If the 'Export what' property is set to 'Data in List query' the 'Maximum number of records to export' property is shown.

        <description>In the case where the 'Export what' property is set to 'Data shown in List' or if the List is not based on a SQL query (in which case the data that is exported is always the 'Data shown in List'), the 'Customize field sizes and column heading in export file' property is shown.

    The syntax for the definition can be shown by clicking the 'Show syntax help' hyperlink.
    The syntax allows you to specify the data type, size and column heading of each column in the Excel file.

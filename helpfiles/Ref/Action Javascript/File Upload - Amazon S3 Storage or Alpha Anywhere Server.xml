                    <title nested="2">Target object name on Amazon S3</title>
                    <description>You can define a function that returns the name of the object in Amazon S3. By default, the filename of the file on the client will be used. Your code can reference e.name, e.size and e.type (the client-side name, size and mime-type of the selected file). Your function must return the name to use. The name can include a folder. For example: return 'myfolder1/' + e.name. This will use the same name as the client-side file but the object will be stored in a folder called 'myfolder1'. NOTE: The target name on Amazon will be available to other Javascript functions in the e.targetName property.</description>

Your code can reference this variables: e.name - name of the file just uploaded, e.type - mime-type, e.aborted - true if the user cancelled, e.size - file size, e.number - if more than one file was uploaded, the number of the file and and e.targetName - the name to use on Amazon to store the file (usually the same as e.name unless your 'Target name on Amazon S3' function returned a different name or specified a folder).</description>

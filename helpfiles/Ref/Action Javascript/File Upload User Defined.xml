    <description>Upload one or more files to the server. A server-side event then gets called to allow you to process the uploaded files.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>This action allows you to upload multiple files at once. Once the files have been uploaded, an Xbasic event handler that you define can process the uploaded data.</p>

                <p>*[TIP]*: To see what information is available to you in the 'e' object that is passed into your Xbasic event handler, put a debug statement in your function:</p>

                <p>When the component is run in Live Preview, the xbasic debugger will open when the debug statement is encountered, allowing you to inspect the 'e' object to see what information is available.</p>

                <p>In order to add an event handler that performs a file upload action, you must add a special [File Upload/Download] control to the UX component.</p>
                <p>The [File Upload/Download] control is in the Other Controls section of the Toolbox.</p>

                <p>Once you have added the [File Upload/Download] control, you can then use Action Javascript to define a File Upload User Defined action.</p>

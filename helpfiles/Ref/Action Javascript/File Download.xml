            <description>
                <p>In order to add an event handler that performs a file download action for an embedded object (i.e. a file that is stored in a binary field in a table), you must add a special [File Upload/Download] control to the UX component.</p>
                <p>The [File Upload/Download] control is in the Other Controls section of the Toolbox.</p>

                <p>Once you have added the [File Upload/Download] control, you can then use Action Javascript to define a File Download action.</p>

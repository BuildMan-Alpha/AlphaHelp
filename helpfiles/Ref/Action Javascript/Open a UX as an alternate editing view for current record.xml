           <description>The UX is opened and the controls in the UX are populated with the current value of the controls in the source Grid or UX. WHen the UX component is closed, the values in the UX component are posted back to the row that is being edited.
               Contrast this action with the previous action, (Open a UX component to Edit Current Record in Grid, or add a new Record). In the previous action, the UX is responsible for saving the Data, so the UX must be bound to tables. However, in this action, the target
               UX component is typically not bound to tables because the data is ultimately saved by the parent component, NOT the target UX component.

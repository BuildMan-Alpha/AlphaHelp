    <topic>Image Capture for List-Detail View - Camera/Photo Library</topic>
    <description>This action is used exclusively for image fields in a List Detail View. Capture an image using the camera, or from the photo library. On devices that don't support a camera, select an image from the filesystem.</description>

            <description>You can build mobile, disconnected applications, that include the ability to capture images using the camera on the device.  When running on a device that does not have a camera, the image to use can be selected from the file system.</description>

                To create a button to capture a new image for an Image control in a List Detail View use the 'Image Capture for List-Detail View - Camera/Photo Library' action.

            <title>Configuring Photo Capture to Use the File System</title>
            <description>In order to capture photos in disconnected application you will need a List control with an associated Detail View. Let's assume that the List control is bound to a SQL table that has these fields</description>
            <list>
                <item>
                    <name>id</name>
                    <description>primary key</description>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>description</name>
                    <description>a character field - contain a description of the photo you have captured</description>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>imageChar</name>
                    <description>a character field that will contain the photo (actually, it will contain the URL that points to the photo - which might be on S3 or on your Alpha Anywhere server).</description>
                </item>
            </list>
            <note>When you are capturing base64 data, the photo field could be a character field, or a binary field. But if you want to use the file system on the mobile device for your photos, your photo field *[must]* be a character field.</note>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p>Assume that you have have added a List control that is bound to this table to your UX. The control type for the photo field (imageChar) in the Detail View should be set to Image.</p>
                <p>First you will need to edit the List control and go to the Fields pane and ensure that the control type for the imageChar field is set to Image. Since imageChar is a character field the List does not set its default type to Image.</p>

                <p>You should then add a button next to this Image control and set the action on this button to Image Capture for List-Detail View - Camera/Photo Library. </p>
                <p>When you click the smart field to configure this action, the builder will open as shown below:</p>

            <description>In this example, the target field (i.e. the Bound field type) is a character field. Therefore we have the option of uploading the image to either Amazon S3, or the Alpha Anywhere server when the data in the List are synchronized. </description>

If both of these buttons are configured to use the Filename option for the Data capture mode, then both of these images will be uploaded to the same target (either the Alpha Anywhere server, or Amazon S3).

This option is only available if you are uploading the photos to the Alpha Anywhere server. It is not available if you are uploading to Amazon S3.</p>
                        <p>When you turn this option on, the genie allows you to map various pieces of EXIF information to fields in the 'target' table. For example, the target table might have a fields called 'latitude' and 'longitude' and you could map the EXIF latitude and longitude values to the corresponding fields in the target table. There may be quite a bit of data in the EXIF object that is extracted from the uploaded image and you can store the raw JSON string (with all of the EXIF information) in a long character field in the target table.</p>

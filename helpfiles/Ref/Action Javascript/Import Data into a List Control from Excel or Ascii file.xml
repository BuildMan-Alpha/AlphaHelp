                    <description>If a List control in a UX component is based on data from a SQL database you can upload an Excel or Ascii file (containing CSV data - comma separated values) and import the data in the file into the SQL table the List Control is based on. After the data is imported, the List is automatically refreshed.</description>
                    <note>If a List is based on a stored procedure, data cannot be imported into the List using this action.</note>

                        <p>The data in the uploaded file must use field names that match the column names in the target SQL table.</p>
                        <p>In the case of a CSV file, the field names must be specified in the first row of data in the file. In the case of an Excel file, column headings in the first row must match the field names.</p>
                    </description>
                    <note>In the case of an Excel file, if the file has multiple tabs, the data on the first tab is imported.</note>

   <topic>Image Capture - Camera/Photo Library</topic>
   <description>Capture an image using the camera, or from the photo library. On devices that
       don't support a camera, select an image from the filesystem. Action calls a function with the 
       Image URI when the image has been obtained.

            <description>The Image Capture - Camera/Photo Library action is used with the UX component. 
                This genie that appears when this action is selected allows you to set how you want to capture 
                an image. On a device that has a camera, the image is captured using a camera. For devices 
                that do not support a camera, you can choose an image from the filesystem. Camera access is 
                either done using PhoneGap or HTML5. Once the image has been captured a Javascript event is fired.

                   <title>Image capture method</title>
                   <description>Specify the method for obtaining the image. If the component is running in a 
                       PhoneGap shell, then you can use PhoneGap to access the camera (if you are not 
                       in a PhoneGap shell, the user will get an error if they try to capture an image). If you 
                       select 'PhoneGapPreferred' then the PhoneGap method will be used if the component 
                       is running in a PhoneGap shell, otherwise the HTML5 method will be used.

                  <title>Move file to permanent storage after capture</title>
                  <description>This property appears if the Image capture method is set to PhoneGap or 
                      PhoneGapPreferred. When an image file is captured using the PhoneGap the captured 
                      file is placed in a temporary storage location that could be cleared when the app 
                      is termitated. Therefore, it is advisable to move the file to a permanent location.

                  <description>This property appears if the Image capture method is set to PhoneGap or 
                      PhoneGapPreferred and is used with iOS. The 'public' option is the application's 
                      'Documents directory', accessible in iTunes file sharing and backed up to the iCloud. 
                      The 'private' option relates to the application's private persisted data, which is 
                      deleted when the application is uninstalled. The 'saved' option is similar to 
                      'private', but is backed up to iTunes.</description>

                       setting will cause the image to be resized only if the raw image size is greater than the maximum

                       When set to '1' there will be no compression. For maximum compression use '0'.

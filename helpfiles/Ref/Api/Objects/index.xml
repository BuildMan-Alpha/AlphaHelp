				<p>An object is a component of Alpha Anywhere. Objects include: tables, fields, forms, browses, buttons, browse columns, the control panel, Alpha Five itself, an so on. All objects have an address which is used when you want to issue a command to do something to an object, or when you want to find out something about an object.</p>
				<p>Alpha Anywhere includes a large number of system objects that are always present. Examples of system objects are: Form, Report, Browse, Control Panel, and Status Bar. Other new objects are created whenever a form or browse window is opened.</p>
				<p>To see a full list of system objects, open the Code Editor, display the Xbasic Explorer, open the Objects node, and then open the System node.</p>

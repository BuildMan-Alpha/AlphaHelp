	<topic>Request Object</topic>
	<description>The Request Object is used with the Alpha Anywhere Classic Application Server. To access the Request object in the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS, use the [Context.Request] object.</description>
	<discussion>A5W pages have access to a system object named Request. This object represents the parsed HTTP request that was received by the Application Server and has a number of properties available.</discussion>
	<sections>
		<section>
			<note>Prior to Version 10, the Request object was local to the page (script) and had to be passed to any functions that need access to it.</note>

		<property readonly="true">
			<name>Request.A5WIncludePath</name>
			<type>C</type>

		</property>
		<property readonly="true">
			<name>Request.Accept</name>
			<type>C</type>
			<description>The value of the Accept HTTP header, which indicates the MIME types that the client can accept. This property was optionally created in versions 6-9, but will always exist in version 10. If an Accept header was not included in the request, the value will be blank. Previously, this property would not exist if the header was not included, requiring additional Xbasic code to test for its existence first.</description>
			<deprecated build="4304">*[xb:Request.Accept]* is deprecated. Use *[link:Request.GetHeader Method]* instead. E.g. *[xb:Request.GetHeader("Accept")]*</deprecated>
		</property>
		<property readonly="true">
			<name>Request.AcceptCharset</name>
			<type>C</type>
			<description>The value of the Accept-Charset HTTP header, which indicates the character sets that the client can accept.  If an Accept-Charset header was not included in the request, the value will be blank. Previously, this property would not exist if the header was not included, requiring additional Xbasic code to test for its existence first.</description>

		<property readonly="true">
			<name>Request.AcceptEncoding</name>
			<type>C</type>
			<description>The value of the Accept-Encoding HTTP header, which indicates the types of transfer encoding accepted by the client. This replaces the optional Accept_Encoding property in versions 6-9. If an Accept-Encoding header was not included in the request, the value will be blank. Previously, this property would not exist if the header was not included, requiring additional Xbasic code to test for its existence first.</description>

		</property>
		<property readonly="true">
			<name>Request.AcceptLanguage</name>
			<type>C</type>
			<description>The value of the Accept-Language HTTP header, which indicate the languages that the client is configured to accept. This replaces the optional Accept_Language property in versions 6-9. If an Accept-Language header was not included in the request, the value will be blank. Previously, this property would not exist if the header was not included, requiring additional Xbasic code to test for its existence first.</description>

		<property readonly="true">
			<name>Request.ApplicationRoot</name>
			<type>C</type>
			<description>The path to the root of the current application, as  seen from the server. For example, if you publish an application to c:\a5webroot\app1 on your server, Request.ApplicationRoot will contain the value c:\a5webroot\app1 for all requests for anything in that application, even if it is in a subfolder. So http://server/app1/page1.a5w would see the same value as  http://server/app1/subfolder1/page2.a5w.</description>
		</property>
		<property readonly="true">
			<name>Request.Body</name>
			<type>C</type>
			<description>The full body of the HTTP request. This will be empty for a GET request, as a GET does not include a body.</description>
		</property>
		<property readonly="true">
			<name>Request.Browser.CookiesEnabled</name>
			<type>L</type>
			<description>A logical value that indicates whether or not the client browser accepts cookies.</description>
		</property>
		<property readonly="true">
			<name>Request.Connection</name>
			<type>C</type>
			<description>The value of the Connection HTTP header, which contains the connection type requested by the client, such as "Keep-Alive". This property was optionally created in versions 6-8, but will always exist in version 9.</description>
		</property>
		<property readonly="true">
			<name>Request.ContentType</name>
			<type>C</type>
			<description>A string that describes any encoding applied by the client before sending the request.  It is typically blank, but some HTML forms may use a type of "multipart/form-data".</description>
		</property>
		<property readonly="true">
			<name>Request.Cookie</name>
			<type>C</type>
			<description>The value of the Cookie HTTP header, which is a string containing all cookies sent by the client. This property was optionally created in versions 6-9, but will always exist in version 10. If a Cookie header was not included in the request, the value will be blank. Previously, this property would not exist if the header was not included, requiring additional Xbasic code to test for its existence first.</description>
			<deprecated build="4304">*[xb:Request.Cookie]* is deprecated. Use *[link:Request.GetHeader Method]* instead. E.g. *[xb:Request.GetHeader("Cookie")]*</deprecated>
		</property>
		<property readonly="true">
			<name>Request.Cookies</name>
			<type>P</type>
			<description>An object containing all of the variables created from the cookie(s) included in the HTTP request sent from the client.</description>
			<important>*[xb:Request.Cookies]* will be changing to be a *[xb:System::Web::HttpCookieCollection]* in the future. Currently it is an Xbasic property class ("dot variable"). Once changed, any Xbasic code expecting a property class will fail. To prepare for the upcoming change, the new *[link:Request.HasCookie method]* and *[link:Request.GetCookie method]* can be used to replace code that directly operates on *[xb:Request.Cookies]*. These methods will continue to work even after the underlying type of *[xb:Request.Cookies]* is changed. These methods also work consistently in both the Classic Application Server and the Application Server for IIS.</important>

			<type>C</type>
			<description>The headers of the request in a CR or CR-LF delimited list.</description>
			<important>*[xb:Request.Headers]* will be changing to a *[xb:System::Collections::Specialized::NameValueCollection]*. Currently it is a character string containing the raw header text of the HTTP request. To prepare for the upcoming change, the new *[link:Request.GetHeader method]* can be used to replace code that directly operates on *[xb:Request.Headers]*. This method will continue to work even after the underlying type of *[xb:Request.Headers]* is changed. The *[xb:Request.GetHeader()]* method also works consistently in both the Classic Application Server and the Application Server for IIS.</important>

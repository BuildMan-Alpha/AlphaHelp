  <discussion><![CDATA[The <TBL>.UNDELETE() method undeletes a range of records in a table. The operation is performed on the records in the table pointed to by the object pointer, <TBL>. If Starting_Record and Ending_Record are not supplied, then Alpha Five undeletes all of the records in the table.
Note : Records can only be undeleted before the table has been packed.

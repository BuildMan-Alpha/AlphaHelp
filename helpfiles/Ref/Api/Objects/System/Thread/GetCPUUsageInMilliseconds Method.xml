	<topic>thread.GetCPUUsageInMilliseconds Method</topic>
	<description>Returns the total CPU usage (kernel and user times) for the thread in milliseconds with fractional values to the right of the decimal point.
	</description>
	<discussion>The value returned is useful as a reference point for computing total CPU usage between operations.
			Capture the current value before the operation and then again after the operation.
			The CPU usage during the operation is the difference between the two values.
			The example below shows a script that performs a long running operation with calls to the Sleep() function
			every thousand operations.  As a result, the wall clock time and the CPU usage can be differentiated.

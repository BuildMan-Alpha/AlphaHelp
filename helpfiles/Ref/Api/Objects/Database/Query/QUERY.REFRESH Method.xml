The .REFRESH() method refreshes a query if the table the query is based on has changed. The method returns .T. (TRUE) if rebuild was needed.
Note : A query is different from an index. Alpha Anywhere automatically synchronizes an index with table data. A query is static and must be deliberately refreshed to reflect table changes.

dim tbl as P
dim qry as P
tbl = table.open("test")
query.filter = "ID <> ''"
query.options = "D"
qry = tbl.query_create()
? qry.refresh()
= .T.

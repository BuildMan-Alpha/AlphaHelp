   <discussion><![CDATA[
The <TBL>.QUERIES_REOPEN() method closes, and then reopens, the table's .MPX files. These are the queries that have been run for the table. This is useful when a query has been run in a different session but with the same table, and you want to bring the current session into synch with the other session.

         <description>Optional. Default = .T. (all records). A character  filter expression that evaluates to a logical value.

The <TBL>.COPY_RECORDS_TO() method copies records in the source table referenced by <TBL> to the target table specified by Table_Name. Data is copied from each field in the source table to the corresponding field with the same name in the target table.
Result is a character string that indicates how many records were copied, and how many records could not be copied because they violated a field rule in the target table. For example, if Result is "230,3", it indicates that 230 records were copied and 3 records were not copied because of a field rule violation. The "violated" table in the Alpha Anywhere program folder shows which records were not copied.
Table_Name can have more fields than the source table. However, at a minimum, it must have all of the fields in the source table, and they must be of the same type and size.

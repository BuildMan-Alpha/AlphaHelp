   <description>Drop the current range from the table.</description>
   <discussion><![CDATA[
The <TBL>.RANGE_DROP() method removes the active range for the table referenced by the object pointer, <TBL>, replacing it with the previous range that was applied to the table. If a range is not dropped, it is maintained in a stack of ranges that grows as New ranges are added.
If you try to drop a range and there are no more ranges on the stack, an error is generated that you can trap with an ON  ERROR GOTO command.

            <description>This script sets the current range to include only customer records that are in the mailing list. All the records in the range have their Mailing_sent field set to Y. The range is then removed to display the records that were previously displayed.

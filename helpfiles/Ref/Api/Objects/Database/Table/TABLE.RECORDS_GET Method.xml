   <discussion><![CDATA[
The <TBL>.RECORDS_GET() method returns the Number_of_Records in the open table referenced by <TBL>. Deleted records are not included in the count. To determine the number of deleted records that are still consuming space in a table, use the <TBL>.RECORDS_DELETED() method. To determine the number of records in an index or query list use the <INDEX>.RECORDS_GET() method.

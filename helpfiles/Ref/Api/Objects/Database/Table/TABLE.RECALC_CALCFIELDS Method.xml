   <discussion><![CDATA[
The <TBL>.RECALC_CALCFIELDS() method recalculates the calculated field in a table. The calculated fields in a table are defined in Field Rules. Normally, as you enter and edit records in a table, the calculated fields are automatically recalculated. However, if you modify an Alpha Anywhere table outside Alpha Anywhere (e.g. by using a program that can read Alpha Anywhere's .dbf files), or by running some Alpha Anywhere Operation (such as a Posting Operation), the calculated fields are not updated.
This method is the Xbasic equivalent of right clicking on the table in the Control Panel, and selecting Utilities > Recalculate Calc Fields.

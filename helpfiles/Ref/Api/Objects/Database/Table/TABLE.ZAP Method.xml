   <discussion><![CDATA[
The <TBL>.ZAP() method removes all records from the table referenced by the <TBL> pointer, but preserves the table structure. You must supply a Safety_Flag to confirm the action, and prevent accidental loss of data. If the Safety_Flag is FALSE (.F.), the Zap operation does not occur.
The Zap operation requires exclusive access to a table. You cannot have a form or browse open that is based on the table. If exclusive read/write access cannot be obtained, the <TBL>.ZAP() method causes an error. Use the <TBL>.FILE_MODE_GET() method to check if the table is opened in exclusive mode.

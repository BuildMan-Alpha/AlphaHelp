  <description><![CDATA[Create a new query - flags (N)ot remembered - if optional order and filter expressions are specified, then the query variable is ignored.
The <TBL>.QUERY_CREATE() method orders and selects data from the table referenced by <TBL>. Originally, you specified the selection criteria, order expression and query options by setting the values of the query variables ( query.description, query.order, etc.). In more modern, robust usage you specify the optional function arguments instead.
Once you have set the query variables, use the <TBL>.QUERY_CREATE() method to run the query. An object pointer, <INDEX>, is returned. <INDEX> will reference either:

Controls whether Alpha Anywhere uses an index, a new query list, or an existing query list to satisfy a query. This string can contain one or more of the following codes:

<name-title>Code</name-title>
<description-title>Description</description-title>
</item>

<item>
<name>N</name>
<description>This flag does two things. The first behaviour is to force Alpha Anywhere to build a query list rather than use an index (should an existing index that matches the query definition be available). The second behaviour is to prevent Alpha Anywhere from setting this query list as the "last used query". (When you open a Form or Browse, if you do not explicitly define a query for the layout, Alpha Anywhere will use the "last used query" for the table or set on which the layout is based. )

<name>I</name>
<description>The I flag is obsolete. It was used by Alpha Anywhere V1 to indicate that the index should be case-insensitive. However since V2, Alpha Five automatically builds all indexes as Case-insensitive. It is documented because in some situations, the Script Recorder will show Xbasic code that includes the "I" flag.

            <description>Alpha Anywhere will only select a previously created query list if the query list is still up to date. It will be out of date if the table was edited after the query list was built.

If Alpha Anywhere selects a previously created query list, or an existing index, the result is returned instantaneously. If a new query list must be built, the time taken to build the query list is a function of the size of the table, and whether Alpha Anywhere can use Lightning Query Optimization.

Query.Filter is the filter expression (a character string). It can be any valid Alpha Anywhere expression that returns a result of .T. (TRUE) or .F. (FALSE). For example, the following are valid filter expressions:
</description>
            <example><![CDATA[
"Lastname = \"smith\" .and. state = \"CA\""
"Lastname = 'smith' .and. state = 'CA'"
".not. (Company = \"\")"
"(lastname = \"smith\" .or. lastname = \"jones\") .and. state = \"ca\""
"(lastname = 'smith' .or. lastname = 'jones') .and. state = 'ca'"
]]></example>
       </section>
       
<section>
            <description>Note : The Query.Filter and Query.Order expressions cannot include references to the table pointer.
Query.Order is the order expression (a character string). It can be any valid Alpha Five expression that references one or more fields. If you want to perform a multi-level sort on character fields, (i.e. sort by Lastname, and within Lastname, sort by firstname ), you simply create an expression on your sort fields, starting with the outer level sort. For example to sort by Lastname, and then by firstname, you would use this order expression:
</description>
            <example><![CDATA[
Lastname + firstname
]]></example>
       </section>       
       
 <section>
            <description>If your sort expression concatenates fields of a different type, (e.g. a character field and a date field), you should convert all of the fields to character. For example:</description>
            <example><![CDATA[
Lastname + cdate(donation_date) ' a character field and a date
Str(score) + Lastname ' a numeric field and a character field 
]]></example>
       </section>

You can set an option in query.options to control whether Alpha Anywhere uses an index, a new query list, or an existing query list to satisfy a query.
Note : You should reset query.filter, query.order, and query.options to NULL ("") after you finish using them. Since they are global variables, this prevents other scripts from accidentally using inappropriate values.
You can determine whether a reference to an index or a query list was returned by using the <INDEX>.TYPE_GET() method. It returns 2 for an index and 6 for a query list.
A query list is like an index in that it does not contain the records themselves. It just contains the key values of the selected records, and pointers to the actual records in the underlying table. Therefore, if you modify a record value when a query list is active, you are modifying the actual data in the table.
The query list files are stored in the private path, which is set using the View > Settings command from the Control Panel. The query list file names match this pattern: $$*.MPX. The View > Settings command has an option that allows you to specify that the $$*.MPX files (i.e. the temporary query files) for a table should be automatically deleted when Alpha Anywhere is exited. Otherwise, Alpha Anywhere will retain the last four queries for each table.
As with indexes, you can use the <TBL>.FETCH_FIND() method with query lists to find records by key value. In most ways, query list behave the same as indexes. The table below summarizes the differences.

            <description>The optional query.description assigns a name to the query. The query name can be up to 24 characters long. If Alpha Anywhere selects an existing query, or index, rather than running building a new query list, the query.description is not used.
The Query.Order expression is used to designate which field or expression sets the primary order of the query. To query a subset of records, you can specify a Query.Filter expression. To be included in the query list, a record must satisfy this filter.
If the Query.Filter expression is undefined, the filter is assumed to be .T. (TRUE). This means that every record in the table will be selected. If the Order expression is undefined, the order is assumed to be record number order. You cannot leave both the Query.Order expression and Query.Filter expression undefined. If you wish to select all records in the table, you should specify:
</description>
            <example><![CDATA[
query.filter = ".T."
]]></example>
       </section>       
<section>
            <description><![CDATA[In the case where <TBL> references a table that is the parent table of a set, the Query.Filter expression can reference fields in the sets primary table, and any child tables linked to the parent table with a one-to-one link. Fields from child tables linked to the parent with a one-to-many link cannot be used in the Query.Filter expression, unless the FLATTENQUERY()or CROSSLEVEL() function is used (See below).
Use the <INDEX>.RECORDS_GET() method to find out how many records were selected by a query.
When you create a query for a table using the <TBL>.QUERY_CREATE() method, then next time a form or browse that is based on the same table is opened, the last created query will be automatically selected, unless the form or browse specifies its own filter and order properties.
Each table has four slots for query lists. If you create more that four queries for a table (without using the <INDEX>.DROP(), or <TBL>.QUERY_DETACH_ALL() method to delete previously built queries), the new queries will take up one of the four slot positions, pushing one of the older queries off the list of open query lists.

<description>When a query is run on an active-link table, Alpha Five will analyze the query expression and determine if any part of the query can be run on the server. If possible, then the portion of the query that can be run on the server, and any remaining portion of the query will be run on the client. If you want to disable the query analyzer and force the query to run on the client, use the "L" query flag.</description>

The <TBL>.RECNO() method returns the record number of the current record in the table referenced by <TBL>. This is useful if you want to store a "bookmark" for the current record. Once you know a record's record number you can return to that record very quickly by setting the primary index to record number and then using the <TBL>.FETCH_FIND() method.

            <description>This script captures the current record number and then after some processing, returns to that record.</description>
            <example><![CDATA[
tbl = table.current()
index = tbl.index_primary_put("Lastname")
tbl.fetch_find("Smith")
record = tbl.recno()
'... some processing which moves to another record
'Return to the bookmarked record
tbl.index_primary_put()'set index to record number
tbl.fetch_find(record) 'return to record

The <TBL>.MOVE_RECORDS_TO() method moves records in the source table referenced by <TBL> to the target table specified by Table_Name. Data is moved from each field in the source table to the corresponding field with the same name in the target table.
Result is a character string that indicates how many records were moved, and how many records could not be moved because they violated a field rule in the target table. For example, if Result is "230,3", it indicates that 230 records were moved and 3 records were not moved because of a field rule violation. The "violated" table in the Alpha Anywhere program folder shows which records were not moved.
Table_Name can have more fields than the source table. However, at a minimum, it must have all of the fields in the source table, and they must be of the same type and size.

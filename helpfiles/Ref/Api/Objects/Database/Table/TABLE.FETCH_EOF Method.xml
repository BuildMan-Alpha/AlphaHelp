   <topic>table.FETCH_EOF Function</topic>
    <description><![CDATA[
The <TBL>.FETCH_EOF() method returns TRUE (.T.) if the most recent fetch in the table or set referenced by the <TBL> object pointer has tried to read past the end of the file, creating an end of file condition. The meaning of end of file differs depending on how the records are currently arranged through the primary index, active range, or current query list. The end of file condition occurs when trying to read beyond the first or last physical record (in record number order), or beyond the first or last record in the current ordering and selection of records.

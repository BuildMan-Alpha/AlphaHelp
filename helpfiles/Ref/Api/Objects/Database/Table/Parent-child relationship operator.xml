		<p>When you need to provide a fully qualified field name in an expression, you place -&gt; between the Table_Name and Field_Name. This is necessary when an expression contains references to fields in multiple tables or when an expression does not have a table context that supplies a default value for Table_Name.</p>
		<p>When referencing a field created in the context of a table or layout, you refer to it with the prefix var-&gt;, indicating that it is a member of the group of variables.</p>
		<p>When referencing a calculated field, you refer to it with the prefix calc-&gt;, indicating that it is a member of the group of calculated values.</p>

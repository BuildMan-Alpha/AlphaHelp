	<description><![CDATA[When you need to provide a fully qualified field name in an expression, you place -> between the Table_Name and Field_Name. This is necessary when an expression contains references to fields in multiple tables or when an expression does not have a table context that supplies a default value for Table_Name.
When referencing a field created in the context of a table or layout, you refer to it with the prefix var->, indicating that it is a member of the group of variables.
When referencing a calculated field, you refer to it with the prefix calc->, indicating that it is a member of the group of calculated values.

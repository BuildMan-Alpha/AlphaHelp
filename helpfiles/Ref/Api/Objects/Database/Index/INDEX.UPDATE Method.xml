            <description>This script opens the Customer_temp.cdx index file and attaches it to the current table. The index file is updated to be sure any records that may have been added or changed while the index file was not open are included in the index.</description>

dim tbl as P

'Index update requires exclusive access to the table.
'If you do not have exclusive access, an error is generated.

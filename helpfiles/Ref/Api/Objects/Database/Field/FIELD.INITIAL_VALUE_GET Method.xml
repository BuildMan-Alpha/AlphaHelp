   <discussion>
The .INITIAL_VALUE_GET() method returns the initial value of the field referenced by the  object pointer. The initial value is the value before any edits have been made to the field. The type of Field_Value returned depends on the field's type. Character and memo fields return character strings; date, numeric, and logical fields return values in their corresponding field types.
This method is useful if you want to determine if the user has changed a field's value when the user edits a record. It is also a way to see if the current record is "dirty", or needs to be saved.

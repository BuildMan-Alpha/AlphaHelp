The .IS_BLANK() method returns TRUE (.T.) if the specified field is blank (i.e., has no value). The field can be specified either by using the  field object pointer, or by using ..IS_BLANK()with a table object pointer and a field name. If the field has an assigned value (including 0), this method returns FALSE (.F.).
For example, a table of average weekly temperatures can have some weeks during which temperatures were not taken. To find an off week, you search for blank temperature fields using the .IS_BLANK() method. You do not search for zero because zero can actually be a valid average temperature.
All fields are blank before data is entered into them.

     <argument>
         <name>key</name>
         <description>An expression used to select a record. The Matching_Expression and the table's or set's primary index key must have the same data type. Alpha Anywhere will automatically pad the Matching_Expression with trailing blanks if necessary so that the length of Matching_Expression matches the index key length. If the table's or set's primary index is record number order, then Matching_Expression is the record number that you want to find.

The .FETCH_FIND() method retrieves the first record in the table or set referenced by  with a primary index key equal to the Matching_Expression parameter.
If .FETCH_FIND()is successful, the found record is retrieved and its Record_Number is returned. If no exact match is found, a negative number corresponding to the record number of the closest matching record is returned.

       <p>The Xbasic Server-side API Library is a collection of functions, classes, and system objects that can be used in server-side scripts. The majority of the Server-side API Library can be used in desktop, web, and mobile applications. If a function, method, class, or object is not available in all application types, the "limitations" section at the bottom of the page will list where it can or cannot be used.</p>

			<description>You will frequently find yourself working with groups of data elements outside of a table. Xbasic provides tools for working with data in three formats:</description>

				<title>Lists</title>
				<description>Data Type: Character, 1 Dimension, Data elements typically separated by CR an LF characters or other distinct characters. Refer tofor more information.</description>
			</case>
			<case>
				<title>Arrays</title>
				<description>Data Type: Any, Multiple dimensions, Alpha Anywhere organizes data elements. You find data by specifying one or more index values.</description>

			<title>Iterating Through Arrays</title>
			<description>The simplest way to reference the data elements in an array is to specify index (or subscript values). You can read or write data elements with a simple assignment operation (=).</description>
			<example><![CDATA[dim chessboard[8,8] as P
dim i as N
dim k as N
dim count as N = 0
for i = 1 to 8
    for k = 1 to 8
        count = count + 1
        if (mod(count,2) = 1) then
            chessboard[i,k].color = "Red"
        else
            chessboard[i,k].color = "Black"
        end if
    next k
next i]]></example>

			<description>If you do not know the size of an array, the size method will provide it. This example returns the size of the second dimension of the chessboard variable.</description>
			<example><![CDATA[dim chessboard[8,8] as P
? chessboard.size(2)
= 8]]></example>
			
		</section>
		<section>
			<description>The *FOR_EACH() function is useful for looping through an array when you do not know its size.</description>
			<example><![CDATA[dim va[5] as P
  
va[1].firstname = "Larry" 
 va[1].lastname = "Jones" 
 va[2].firstname = "Sue" 
 va[2].lastname = "Brown" 
 va[3].firstname = "Toby" 
 va[3].lastname = "Smith" 
 va[4].firstname = "Bob" 
 va[4].lastname = "Saget" 
 va[5].firstname = "Mary" 
 va[5].lastname = "Johnson" 


 vList = *for_each(x,"Dear "+x.firstname + " " + x.lastname,va) 
 ? vlist 
 = Dear Larry Jones 
 Dear Sue Brown 
 Dear Toby Smith 
 Dear Bob Saget 
 Dear Mary Johnson

	<title>Iterating Through Collections</title>
<section>
	<description>The following script shows how to read the data elements in a collection. First, create a collection.</description>
	<example><![CDATA[dim mycollection as u
mycollection.SET("FJ","Fred Jones")
mycollection.SET("BB","Bryan Boyd")
mycollection.SET("KL","Kim Lee")
mycollection.SET("KB","Karen Boyd")
mycollection.SET("EL","Erica Loyd")]]></example>
</section>		

<section>
	<description>Now, read and display each value. Working with a collection is similar to working with an indexed table.</description>
	<example><![CDATA[dim k as N
dim i as N = 1
dim keyval as C
dim currentval as C
k = mycollection.size()
keyval = mycollection.first()
currentval = mycollection.get(keyval)
ui_msg_box("", currentval)
while (i < k)
    keyval = mycollection.next(keyval)
    currentval = mycollection.get(keyval)
    i = i + 1
    ui_msg_box("", currentval)
end while]]></example>
</section>	

<section>
	<description><![CDATA[Use the <COLLECTION>.SET() method to change a data element in a collection. If the specified key value exists, the method changes the data element. If the key does not exist, the method adds a new data element to the end of the collection.]]></description>
	<example><![CDATA[dim currentval as C
dim newval as C
i = 1
keyval = mycollection.first()
currentval = mycollection.get(keyval)
newval = currentval + " new"
mycollection.set(keyval, newval)
ui_msg_box("",mycollection.get(keyval))
while (i < k)
    keyval = mycollection.next(keyval)
    currentval = mycollection.get(keyval)
    newval = currentval + " new"
    mycollection.set(keyval, newval)
    i = i + 1
    ui_msg_box("", mycollection.get(keyval))
end while]]></example>

		<description>The following script shows how to use *FOR_EACH() to step through the elements in a CR-LF delimiter list.</description>
		<example><![CDATA[dim lst1 as C

lst2 = *for_each(x, left(x,3), lst)
? lst1
= Alabama
Alaska
Arizona

		<description>The following script uses a FOR EACH ... NEXT to step through elements of a list.</description>
		<example><![CDATA[dim lst1 as C

    lst2 = lst2 + left(x,3) + crlf()

		<description>The following script shows how to use LINE_COUNT() to determine the size of a list and extract its elements with WORD().</description>
		<example><![CDATA[dim lst1 as C
dim lst2 as C
dim line as C
dim k as N
lst1 = cstates("S"+ crlf())
k = line_count(lst1)
for i = 1 to k
    line = word(lst1, i, crlf())
    lst2 = lst2 + left(line,3) + crlf()
next i
? lst2
= Ala

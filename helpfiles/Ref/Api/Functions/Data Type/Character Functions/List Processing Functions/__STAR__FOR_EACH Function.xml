    <description>Executes the command specified by "each" on every entry in a CR-LF delimited "list". "Tag" refers to each entry in the "list".</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>*FOR_EACH() is a very quick and efficient way of performing a command on every entry in a CR-LF delimited list of values, or in an array. It is an alternative to writing an Xbasic loop.</p>
        <p>Result is a CR-LF delimited list of return values generate when the command/expression specified by Each is executed.</p>
        <p>The *COUNTER() function can be used inside the *FOR_EACH() function to return the current count of the number of entries processed. See example below.</p>
        <p>It is easiest to explain how this function works by example. Assume you have a CR-LF list of names:</p>

            <description>You would like to get a list of first names only by selecting the word after the comma:</description>

                <p>In this example, " fullname" is an arbitrary tag that is defined. The Each argument is: word(fullname, 2, ","). This function is performed on each entry in the input list of names. The tag fullname is used in the expression to refer to each entry in the input list.</p>
                <p>If the tag had been specified as "foo" for example, then the expression would be:</p>

            <description>In this case, this same result can be achieved using the word_change() function:</description>

= John

            <p>However, the syntax for *FOR_EACH() is easier to understand since it uses standard Alpha Anywhere functions.</p>
            <p>In other situations, such as the example below, where the *FOR_EACH() function is executing a command, WORD_CHANGE() cannot be used as an alternative.</p>

            <description>This example demonstrates using a filter expression. Only the entries where the filter expression returns true are returned:</description>

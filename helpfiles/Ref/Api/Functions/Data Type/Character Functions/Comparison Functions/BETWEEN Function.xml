   <discussion>
BETWEEN() returns .T. (TRUE) if Expression is greater than or equal to Lower_Value and less than or equal to Higher_Value.   Otherwise, BETWEEN() returns .F. (FALSE). All expressions used with the function must be of the same type.
 Note : When you specify character expressions or constants, BETWEEN() determines whether the first value falls between the next two alphabetically. For example, the last name "Mederos" is between "Cario" and "Rovers".

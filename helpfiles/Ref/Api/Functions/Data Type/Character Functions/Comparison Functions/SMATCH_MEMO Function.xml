   <discussion>
Searches within the text of a Memo field. Returns .T. (TRUE) if pattern is found in the memo field memofield. The field being searched cannot be a Rich Text Memo field.
SMATCH_MEMO is useful for selecting records using query selection criteria, filter expressions, or conditional expressions, such as:
 CITY = "Boston" .and. smatch_memo("COMMENTS", "*rent*")
 Find_String must include the standard wildcard characters * or ? , as described for the function LIKE(). SMATCH_MEMO() is case insensitive (unlike LIKE() and SMATCH() , which are case sensitive).

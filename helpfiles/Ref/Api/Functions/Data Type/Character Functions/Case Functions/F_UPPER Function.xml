F_UPPER() capitalizes the first letter in Input_String. F_UPPER() does not change the case of any other characters.
Note : Alpha Anywhere provides a variety of field rules and formatting options for character fields, including options controlling capitalization. Before defining an expression, check whether Alpha Anywhere already provides a formatting option that meets your needs.

You can create a calculated field, NAME, using the following expression:

            <example><![CDATA[
f_upper( trim(FIRST) ) + SPACE(1) + f_upper( substr(MIDDLE, 1, 1) ) + space(1) + f_upper(LAST)
]]></example>
       </section>

            <description>This forces the first letter of each field to uppercase as the fields are concatenated.
If you are starting out with a capitalized word, you may want to first use the LOWER()function.

            <example><![CDATA[
dim thisword as C = "UPPER"
? f_upper( lower(thisword) )
= "Upper"

         0 = The two blobs are identical in content and length. 
         1= The first blob is greater than the second.
         -1 = The second blob is greater than the first.

    <discussion>
The BlobCompare() function indicates whether which of two blob variables is larger than the other. If the two variables have the same content, but different lengths, the longer variable is larger. If the two variables have different content, the comparison is byte-wise from the beginning until one of the two variables has a larger value.

Converts a Formatted_Time containing a time value to an integer Count equal to the number of seconds past midnight.
You typically use TOSECONDS() to perform time arithmetic to compute the elapsed time between a starting and ending time, or to compute an ending time from a start time and an elapsed time.
The TOSECONDS() function supports fractional seconds, e.g. toseconds("3:23:05.23 pm").

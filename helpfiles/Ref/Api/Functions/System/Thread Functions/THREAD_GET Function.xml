   <description>The name of the current thread. If run from the interactive window, it will always return "Main" because the interactive window runs in the Main thread. This can be very helpful if you'd like your code to behave slightly differently depending on which thread it is running in.

For internal use only. The THREAD_GET() function returns the name of the current thread.
No user interface related commands are allowed in a thread. Using any command that attempts to create or manipulate any type of user interface from within a thread will cause Alpha Anywhere to hang. Examples of such invalid functions include debug() , ui_*, StatusBar.*, ControlPanel.*, trace.*, etc. .

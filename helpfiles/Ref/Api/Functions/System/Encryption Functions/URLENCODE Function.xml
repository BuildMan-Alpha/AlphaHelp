URLENCODE() encodes text so that it can be safely used as Part of a URL. Many characters are not allowed within URLs so their representation must be encoded in order to use them. This function automatically handles the encoding. Many characters are not allowed within URLs, so their representation must be encoded in order to use them. URLENCODE() creates a character string by converting all illegal URL address characters in the URL_String to their escape sequences.
If you had a URL like the following, with multiple name-value pairs separated by ampersands "&", then you would have to encode each of the pairs separately.

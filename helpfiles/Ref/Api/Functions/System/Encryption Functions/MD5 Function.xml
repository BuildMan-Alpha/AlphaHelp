Takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input. MD5() is a more programmer friendly version of *MD5() that returns a 32 character (128-bit) "fingerprint" or "message digest" of Input_Data of arbitrary length. It is conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce two messages having the same message digest, or to produce any message having a given pre-specified target message digest. The MD5 algorithm is intended for digital signature applications, where a large file must be "compressed" in a secure manner before being encrypted with a private (secret) key under a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA.

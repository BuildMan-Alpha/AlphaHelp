    <discussion>The HTTP_UNCHUNK() function unchunks an HTTP message body that has had a chunked transfer encoding applied to it. Some HTTP messages are sent by servers (or proxies) using a chunked transfer encoding. The full definition can be found in RFC 2616, section 3.6.1. HTTP_GET, HTTP_GET_PAGE2(), HTTP_POST(), HTTP_POST_PAGE2(), and HTTP_FETCH()all automatically unchunk a message, so it would actually be quite rare that a user needs this function.

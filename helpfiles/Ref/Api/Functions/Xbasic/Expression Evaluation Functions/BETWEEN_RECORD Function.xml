BETWEEN_RECORD() returns a character filter expression that uses the two record number values and selects records from the table. This function is only useful in Xbasic scripts. First_Record and Last_Record are number variables. They are the first and last records in a range of records to find.
Frequently in Xbasic scripts, you need to specify a filter expression in quotes. It can get quite tricky to do this if your Start and End values are stored in variables.

            <example><![CDATA[
dim shared First as N 
 dim shared Last as N

t = tbl.open("customer") 
 query.filter = "between_record(" + "\"" + First + "\", " + "\"" + Last + "\")" 
 t.query_create()

query.filter ? between_record("5", "15"), assuming First = 5 and Last = 15

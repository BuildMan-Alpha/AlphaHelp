BETWEEN_NUM()  returns a character  filter expression that uses the two number values and selects records  from the table. This function is only useful in Xbasic scripts. Field_Name is a numeric field or expression to search  on. Low_Value and High_Value are numeric variables.  They are the first and last values in a range of records to find.
Frequently in Xbasic scripts, you need to specify a filter expression  in quotes. It can get quite tricky to do this if your Low_Value and High_Value values are stored in variables.  For example, the following code fragment shows how to specify a filter  expression for an Xbasic query:

            <example><![CDATA[
dim shared First as N 
dim shared Last as N
t = tbl.open("customer") 
query.filter = "between(qty, " + First + ", "  + Last + ")" 
t.query_create()
]]></example>

            <description>Assuming that First contains 3, and Last contains 10, query.filter will contain the following  value:
</description>
            <example><![CDATA[
"between(qty, 3, 10)"
]]></example>
       </section>
       <section>
            <description>This is a valid filter expression. However, it is very cumbersome to  write the expression that defines the query.filter variable. The BETWEEN_CHAR() utility function makes it easier to write  this filter expression. For example:
</description>
            <example><![CDATA[
query.filter = between_num("qty", First, Last)
]]></example>
       </section>
       <section>
            <description>If you are searching on fields/expressions of other types, use the appropriate  utility function. Assuming that lastname, qty, and invoice_date are  field names.

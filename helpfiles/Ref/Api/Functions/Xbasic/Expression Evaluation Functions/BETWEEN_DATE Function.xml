BETWEEN_DATE()  returns a character  filter expression that uses the two date values and selects records  from the table. This function is only useful in Xbasic scripts. Field_Name is a date field or expression to search  on. Low_Value and High_Value are date variables. They are the first and last values in a range of records  to find.
Frequently in Xbasic scripts, you need to specify a filter expression  in quotes. It can get quite tricky to do this if your Low_Value and High_Value values are stored in variables.  For example, the following code fragment shows how to specify a filter  expression for an Xbasic query:

            <description>This is a valid filter expression. However, it is very cumbersome to  write the expression that defines the query.filter variable. The BETWEEN_DATE() utility function makes it easier to write  this filter expression. For example:

            <example><![CDATA[
query.filter = between_date("Invoice_Date", First,  Last)
]]></example>

            <description>If you are searching on fields/expressions of other types, use the appropriate  utility function. Assuming that lastname, qty, and invoice_date are  field names.

The following function determines the fiscal year of a date. The begin_date is the first day of the fiscal year.
FUNCTION fiscal_year as N (current_date as D,  begin_date as D )
fiscal_year = -1
if (alltrim(cdate(current_date) ) = "") .or. (alltrim(cdate(begin_date) )  = "") .or. (day(begin_date) > 1)
    end
end if
select
    case month(begin_date) = 1
        fiscal_year  = year(current_date)
    case between(month(current_date),month(begin_date),12)
        fiscal_year  = year(curdate)
    case between(month(current_date),  1, month(begin_date)-1)
        fiscal_year  = year(current_date) - 1
end select
END FUNCTION

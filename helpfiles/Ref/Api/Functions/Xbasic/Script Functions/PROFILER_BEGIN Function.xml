  <discussion>
    <p>Insert the PROFILER_BEGIN() command in an Xbasic script at the point that you want to begin profiling a script. Insert the PROFILER_END()command at the point that you want to end profiling a script. When the PROFILER_END() command is encountered, Alpha Anywhere dumps a report to the Trace window showing each line in your Xbasic script that was executed, the number of times it was executed, and the time taken to execute the command.</p>
    <p>Profiling a script can help you determine which parts of a script might be taking a long time to execute. It can also help you debug your script because in complex scripts with lots of loops and branches, it can be difficult to see exactly which lines in your script actually get executed. The profiler report shows you what got executed.</p>

      <description>Assume that you have created this script:</description>
      <example code="xb"><![CDATA[profiler_begin()
t = table.open("customer")
t.fetch_first()
while .not. t.fetch_eof()
    t.change_begin()
    t.Company = upper(t.Company)
    t.change_end(.T.)
    t.fetch_next()
end while
t.close()
profiler_end()]]></example>

      <description>After running this script, the Trace window will show:</description>

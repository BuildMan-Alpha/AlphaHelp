    <discussion><![CDATA[
The XBASIC_ASYNCHRONOUS() function causes the script to wait until after other Alpha Anywhere processes have been completed, not including screen refreshes.
 Note : XBASIC_WAIT_FOR_IDLE()  waits for the main loop to idle. The main loop is the entire Alpha Anywhere application. For example, if there are any messages that need to be processed (such as a screen repaint), the Xbasic script will wait until those messages have been processed. So for example, this will allow a screen repaint, a focus change, initializing of menus and toolbars on a  form open, etc. to happen before your Xbasic script continues. < br> <br> UI_YIELD(), which was added in Version 7, is similar to XBASIC_WAIT_FOR_IDLE() , but just allows pending screen repaints to happen. It does not allow other messages (such as form activate, deactivate, change of focus etc) in the message queue to happen.

  <discussion>
    <p>The XBASIC_SYNCHRONOUS() function forces the script to run in the foreground thread. There are a limited number of places where this function would be necessary, but one example is when you are setting properties on objects in a form in a loop. If you did not use this function, the loop might run in a background thread, and setting the properties will be slow. By using this function, the loop is forced to run in the foreground thread, and as a result, it runs quickly.</p>

    <discussion><![CDATA[
The XBASIC_SYNCHRONOUS() function forces the script to run in the foreground thread. There are a limited number of places where this function would be necessary, but one example is when you are setting properties on objects in a form in a loop. If you did not use this function, the loop might run in a background thread, and setting the properties will be slow. By using this function, the loop is forced to run in the foreground thread, and as a result, it runs quickly.
 Note : XBASIC_WAIT_FOR_IDLE()  waits for the main loop to idle. The main loop is the entire Alpha Anywhere application. For example, if there are any messages that need to be processed (such as a screen repaint), the Xbasic script will wait until those messages have been processed. So for example, this will allow a screen repaint, a focus change, initializing of menus and toolbars on a  form open, etc. to happen before your Xbasic script continues. < br> <br> UI_YIELD(), which was added in Version 7 , is similar to XBASIC_WAIT_FOR_IDLE() , but just allows pending screen repaints to happen. It does not allow other messages (such as form activate, deactivate, change of focus etc) in the message queue to happen.

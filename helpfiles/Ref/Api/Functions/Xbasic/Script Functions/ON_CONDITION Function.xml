        <p>The ON_CONDITION() function registers some Code to be executed when a Logical_Expression is true. When the Logical_Expression is true, the Code is executed. After the code is executed, the ON_CONDITION() event is de-registered, so that the next time the Logical_Expression is true, the code no longer executed. You can register as many ON_CONDITION() events as you want. Generally, the ON_CONDITION() events will impose very little overhead on Alpha Anywhere. However, if your Logical_Expression is complex, and/or involves User Defined Functions, it is possible that the ON_CONDITION() events will represent a drain on performance.</p>
        <p>It is important to recognize that when the condition is true the code executes, and then the condition is cleared. If you want something to happen every time a condition is met, then you must rerun the ON_CONDITION() command after the condition is met.</p>

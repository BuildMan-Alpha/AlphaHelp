    <p>The XBASIC_WAIT_FOR_IDLE() function causes the script to wait for other Alpha Anywhere processes and screen refreshes to complete before proceeding.</p>
    <p>The function forces each action to complete before the next action starts. If code is written that requires one action to complete before the next begins, then the XBASIC_WAIT_FOR_IDLE() would be appropriate. An example is a succession of operations where the result of one operation, such as an append, must be completed before an update operation.</p>

      <note>
        <p>XBASIC_WAIT_FOR_IDLE() waits for the main loop to idle. The main loop is the entire Alpha Anywhere application. For example, if there are any messages that need to be processed (such as a screen repaint), the Xbasic script will wait until those messages have been processed. So for example, this will allow a screen repaint, a focus change, initializing of menus and toolbars on a  form open, etc. to happen before your Xbasic script continues.</p>
        <p>UI_YIELD() is similar to XBASIC_WAIT_FOR_IDLE(), but only allows pending screen repaints to happen. It does not allow other messages (such as form activate, deactivate, change of focus etc) in the message queue to happen.</p>

<discussion>The A5W_INCLUDE() function includes a file within an A5W page. The specified file will be included within the page before the it is evaluated. This is useful to include headers, footers and functions that will be used on multiple pages. This function only works with the Application Server. The function works recursively, meaning that if the included file has any A5W_INCLUDE() itself, they will also be processed. If the file to be included cannot be found, A5W_INCLUDE() will generate an error.
The A5W_INCLUDE() command is evaluated at runtime. </discussion>

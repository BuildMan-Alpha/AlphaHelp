    dim ops as p
    ops.Action = "Filter"
    ops.filter = "country = :country and city = :city"
    ops.order = "companyname desc"

    'the arguments are specified in a crlf() delimited string. 
    'syntax is argumentValue|||type|argumentName
    ops.parameters = "UK|||c|country" + crlf() + "London|||c|city"

    'specify the id of the list to filter
    ops.listId = "list1"

    dim xb as c
    xb = a5_UX_Action(e,ops,"ajaxListAction")

    myAjaxCallback = xb 

end function 
]]></example>
        
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>List Control Action: Refresh List</title>

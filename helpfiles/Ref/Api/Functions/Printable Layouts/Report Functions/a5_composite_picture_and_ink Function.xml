        <argument>
            <name>basepath</name>
            <type>C</type>

        <p>*[xb:a5_composite_picture_and_ink()]* generates a composite image by combining a background picture with ink data. This function takes the name of the field that contains the picture, the name of the field that contains the ink, and (optionally) a base path. It creates a composite image with the ink overlayed on top of the picutre.</p>

            <title>Example</title>
            <description>
                <p>For example, assume that your database has fields called *[xb:picture1]* and *[xb:annotation1]* and you want to print the ink in *[xb:annotation1]* over the picture in *[xb:picture1]*. You could create a calculated field called *[xb:compositeImage]* and add this calculated field to your report.</p>

        <title>Caveats</title>
        <warning>
        <p>The Windows 10 custom scaling feature can interfere with the sizing of the SVG produced by the *[xb:a5_composite_picture_and_ink]* function.</p>
        <p>If you are running under Windows 10, and Best Fit images in reports are showing up smaller than the space provided check the
         Control Panel/Appearance and Personalization / Display Dialog, and make sure that the scaling is set to the default of 100%.</p>
        <p>Credit goes to Ted Thomas for discovering this issue.</p>

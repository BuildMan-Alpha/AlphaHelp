                <p>For example, assume that your database has fields called *[xb:picture1]* and *[xb:annotation1]* and you want to print the ink in *[xb:annotation1]* over the picture in *[xb:picture1]*. You could create a calculated field called *[xb:compositeImage]* and add this calculated field to your report.</p>

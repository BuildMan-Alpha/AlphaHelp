    <description>Functions for working with Storage Connections to upload, download, delete, and list files stored on Cloud Storage services such as AmazonS3, Azure, and SharePoint.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>[Storage] is an Alpha Anywhere abstraction for dealing with different types of storage using a standard interface. Alpha Anywhere supports several types of storage, including AmazonS3, Azure, SharePoint, and Disk. The *[xb:a5storage_*]* Xbasic functions are for working with files saved to storage in Xbasic scripts. These functions can be used in Ajax Callbacks or the [File Upload - User Defined] Action Javascript.</p>
        <p>Named storage connections are created and managed in the Storage Connection Strings dialog found under the *[ui:Tools]* &gt; *[ui:Storage connection strings]* menu on the Web Projects Control Panel. See [Storage Connections] for more information.</p>

The CROSSLEVEL() function is useful when you have a form view of a set which has a one-many relationship. With the CROSSLEVEL() function you can filter the list of records using fields from the one-many child tables.
 Note : CROSSLEVEL()  rcreates an intermediate index file of type .ASX. For this reason you must open the set with write access.

            <description>For example, you might define the following query:</description>
            <example><![CDATA[
crosslevel("invoice_items->description = \"Techelon Safety Glasses\"")

]]></example>
       </section>

            <description>This might find that there were 3 invoices that had these line items. When you viewed these 3 invoices, however, the embedded browse would show all of the line items for that invoice (not just the line items for Techelon Safety Glasses). Contrast this with the FLATTENQUERY() function which treats a multi-level set as a flat table.

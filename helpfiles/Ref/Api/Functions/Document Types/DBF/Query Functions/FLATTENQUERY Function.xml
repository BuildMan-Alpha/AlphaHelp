In a form or a browse, Alpha Anywhere does not allow you to include fields from a one-to-many child table when you create a query (exception - see the Crosslevel() function). (This restriction does not apply to report, letters and labels). However, if you use the FLATTENQUERY() function, you can include one-to-many child fields in your query.

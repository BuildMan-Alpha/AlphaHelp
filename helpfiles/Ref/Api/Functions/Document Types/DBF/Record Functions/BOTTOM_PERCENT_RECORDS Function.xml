BOTTOM_PERCENT_RECORDS()  is a special function used only in queries to return the bottom Percent of records in a table for a given sort order. If the optional filter is supplied, only the records selected by the filter are returned.
 Note : The term "bottom" does not imply that record values are examined. "Bottom" means last, given the current sort order.

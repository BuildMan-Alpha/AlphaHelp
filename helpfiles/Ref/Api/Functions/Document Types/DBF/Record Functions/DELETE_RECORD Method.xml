	<description><![CDATA[As the example shows, a dot variable is created with properties for all of the fields 
that you want to delete. 
In the above example, we specify the 'firstname' and 'company' fields in the customer table.
Once the dot variable has been created, the <Tbl>.delete_record() method is called. 
This method takes as its argument the dot variable with the field values.

	<description><![CDATA[The method returns a dot variable. 
The dot variable has an 'has_errors' property which lets you know if the method succeeded or not. 
If not, then the errors are returned in an array called 'errors' which is a sub-property of the dot variable.

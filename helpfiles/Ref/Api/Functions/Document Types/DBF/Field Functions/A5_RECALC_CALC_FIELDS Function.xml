The A5_RECALC_CALC_FIELDS() function recalculates the calculated fields in the specified table. The table does not have to be part of the current database. 
Important: If you need to recalculate calculated fields as part of an application, you should use the ((TBL.RECALC_CALCFIELDS Method|table.Recalc_CalcFields() method)). The a5_recalc_calc_fields() function closes any sessions that are bound to the table whose calculated fields you are recalculating, and this could cause instability in a running application.

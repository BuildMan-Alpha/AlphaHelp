Although the corresponding TABLE()and DB() functions are similar, there  are differences between the two. The TABLE() functions have a simpler  syntax, and are more powerful because they take a full filter expression.  However,  the TABLE() functions tend to be slower unless they can take advantage  of Lightning  Query Optimization. The DB() functions are more complex to write  and are less flexible, but execute quicker.

    <discussion>
        <p>This function is a wrapper on the TransForm CreateNewFormInstance API method. It allows you to create a new form instance and assign the instance to a particular user.</p>
        <p>Creating a new form instance programmatically is typically done is "dispatch applications". When the user to whom the new form instance was assigned opens TransForm on their device and performs a refresh action, the new form instances assigned to that user will appear in the list of existing forms. This is called a "dispatch application" because a new task has been "dispatched" to a user.</p>

                <p>Assume you have a form called "Pictures" and you want to create a new form instance with the data shown below, and you want to assign this new form instance to a user called user1@mycompany.com.</p>

            <example code="xb"><![CDATA[dim formId as c = "Pictures"

                <p>The a5TransForm_CreateFromInstance() function is a convenient ways to use the TransForm API from Xbasic. It does not add any additional functionality to the API. You can use the API in your Xbasic code to achieve the same results.</p>

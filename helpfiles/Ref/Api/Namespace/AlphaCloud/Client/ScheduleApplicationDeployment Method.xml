	<description>ScheduleApplicationDeployment schedules a deployment for some time now or in the future based on the settings in an application deployment itself and the parameters passed.
			<br/>
			An application deployment associates an application with a web site and (optionally) a path within that application.
			When the path is "/", we refer to that as the root application for a web site.
			When the path is "/&lt;some name@gt;", the application is a child application of the web site.
			<br/>
			An application deployment is "scheduled" when the deployment is assigned a starting and (optionally) ending data and time,
			a version of the application, and a build of Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS.

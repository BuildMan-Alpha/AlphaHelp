    <description>
        <p>ScheduleApplicationDeployment schedules a deployment for some time now or in the future based on the settings in an application deployment itself and the parameters passed.</p>
        <p>An application deployment associates an application with a web site and (optionally) a path within that application. When the path is "/", we refer to that as the root application for a web site. When the path is "/&lt;some name@gt;", the application is a child application of the web site.</p>
        <p>An application deployment is "scheduled" when the deployment is assigned a starting and (optionally) ending data and time, a version of the application, and a build of Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS.</p>

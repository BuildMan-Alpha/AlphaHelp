	<p>A deployment associates an application with a web site (and optionally a path) and a security configuration.  
		While the web site, path, and security application do not generally change over time, it is more common
		to change the version of the application and/or the build of Alpha Anywhere being deployed.</p>
		
		<p>Each occurence of a deployment schedule has a start and (optionally) and end time.</p>

		<p>Each schedule is assigned a specific version of the application, 
			a specific build of Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS.</p>

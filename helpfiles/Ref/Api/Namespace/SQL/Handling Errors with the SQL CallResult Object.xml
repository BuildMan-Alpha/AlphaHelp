	<topic>Handling Errors with the SQL::CallResult Object</topic>
	<description>AlphaDAO contains a special object named SQL::CallResult to help you diagnose problems. Suppose you take the following script, which works, and change the name of the database from "alphasports.mdb" to "alpha.mdb".</description>

			<example><![CDATA[dim conn as SQL::Connection
? conn.open("{A5API=Access,FileName='C:\Program Files\a5v8\MDBFiles\Alphasports.mdb',UserName='Admin'}")
= .T.
 ]]></example>

			<description>After:</description>
			<example><![CDATA[dim conn as SQL::Connection
? conn.open("{A5API=Access,FileName='C:\Program Files\a5v8\MDBFiles\Alpha.mdb',UserName='Admin'}")
= .F.]]></example>

			<description>Note that the .Open() method returned .F. (FALSE), meaning that an error occurred. If you want to know what went wrong, take a look at the connection object's .CallResult property.</description>
			<example><![CDATA[? conn.CallResult
= API = ""
Canceled = .F.
Code = 195
Error = .T.
LastInsertedIdentity = 
NativeCode = -1
NativeText = [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver] Could not find file '(unknown)'.

			<description>Or to narrow things down, look at the CallResult.text property.</description>
			<example><![CDATA[? conn.CallResult.Text

			<description>AlphaDAO does its best to interpret the error messages returned by back-end databases into meaningful statements that you can use.</description>

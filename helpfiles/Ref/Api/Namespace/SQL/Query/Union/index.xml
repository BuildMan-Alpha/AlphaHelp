			<description>The SQL::Query::Union object describes the union of two tables. A query may include one or more UNION clauses. Each subsequent unioned query is concatenated onto the original query (columns need to match). The set can be followed by an ORDER BY clause to reorder the results.
For example:</description>
			<example><![CDATA[SELECT DepartmentName from departments
    UNION
     SELECT Name from OldDepartments
     ORDER BY 1]]></example>

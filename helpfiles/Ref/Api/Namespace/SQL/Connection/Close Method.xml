   <prototype>V Close(CloseSSHTunnel = .f.)</prototype>
  
   <discussion>
The Close() method closes a SQL connection if it is open.
Note :This call is optional but may result in better performance. 
The connection will close when the object is deleted, but it is generally a good idea to free up a connection and the resources it holds as soon as it is no longer needed.
The optional argument CloseSSHTunnel defaults to false.  Setting this value to .t. will force any associated SSH tunnel to close along with the connection.  
In most cases you want an SSH tunnel to remain open for the life of the process because establishing a tunnel is expensive.

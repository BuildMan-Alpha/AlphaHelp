			<description>RegisterAssembly() connects an assembly and all of its classes to the Alpha Anywhere type system within a namespace
 The basic idea here is that you can "register" a .NET assembly in an Alpha Anywhere namespace and use it as if it were built in. This type can be DIMmed in any script after the type is registered.
 Once the assembly is registered, which is required once per execution of Alpha Anywhere, instances can be DIMmed for each of its classes in any script.

			<note>ParentNameSpace is optional. If an empty string is provided, the class is registered under the DotNet namespace.

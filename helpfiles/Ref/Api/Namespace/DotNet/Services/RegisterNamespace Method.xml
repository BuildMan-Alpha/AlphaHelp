	<discussion>RegisterNamespace() connects a .NET namespace within an assembly, and all of its classes, to the Alpha Anywhere type system within an Alpha Anywhere namespace.

 The basic idea is that you can "register" a .NET assembly in an Alpha Anywhere namespace and use it as if it were built in. This type can be dimmed in any script after the type is registered. This can be useful where you only want a single namespace tree from an assembly to be visible, or when you have an assembly with multiple namespaces that belong in different trees. Once the assembly namespace is registered, which is required once per execution of Alpha Anywhere, instances can be DIMmed for each of its classes in any script.

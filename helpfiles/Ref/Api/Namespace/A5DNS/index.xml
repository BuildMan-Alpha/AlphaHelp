	<description><p>The A5DNS namespace is used to manage DNS settings for service APIs such as Amazon AWS Route53.
	Route53 is currently the only implementation of A5DNS, but we expect to add others.</p>
	<p>The DNS manager component helps maintain CNAME entries from within XBasic.</p>
	<p>You can manage a domain on Route53 with the DNS manager (look for other providers in the future).</p>

				<ol>
				<li>On Route53, create a hosted zone composed of a new subdomain in the form 
					&lt;new subdomain&gt;.&lt;existing domain&gt;<br/>
					<strong>Important: </strong>Take note of the list of name servers for the hosted zone.
					</li>
				<li>Using the tools for your existing provider, create a name server (NS) record for the new
					subdomain.  Again, this is in the format 
					&lt;new subdomain&gt;.&lt;existing domain&gt;<br/>
					Enter the name servers from the hosted zone in step 1 as the list 
						of name servers for the NS record.
					</li>

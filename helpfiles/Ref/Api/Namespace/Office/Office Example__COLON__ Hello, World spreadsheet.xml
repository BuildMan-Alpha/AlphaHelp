Copy the code below into an Alpha Anywhere Xbasic script and run it.
The code assumes that you have a version of Excel that can handle .XLSX files installed. If you have an older version of Excel, change ExcelDocument to Excel2003Document, and .xlsx to .xls. If you don't have Excel or a compatible spreadsheet program installed, remove the line that starts with sys_open.

    <description>Alpha Five Version 7 honors only the static keyword. Eventually, Alpha Anywhere will eventually honor others keywords, such as private. A good way to describe the static attribute is to look at the documentation for Xbasic methods.</description>

                <p>Take the file class for example. *[xb:h = file.open()]* is calling a *[xb:static]* method on the file class. It is not a method on an instantiated object. On the other hand *[xb:h.close()]* is documented as  *[xb:&lt;file&gt;.close()]*. The *[xb:&lt;&gt;]* notation is used to indicate that *[xb:&lt;file&gt;]*is an object instance. The *[xb:.close()]* method is not a *[xb:static]* method because it operates on an object instance. (i.e. the object exists). The .*[xb:open()]* method is a *[xb:static]* method because it does not require that the object instance exists; it causes the object to come into existence.</p>
                <p>A *[xb:static]* method does not have to cause an object to come into existence. *[xb:file.drives_get()]* is an example of a static method that does not instantiate  an object. It does not require a file instance to do its job. It could just as easily have been called *[xb:files_get_drive_list()]*. Calling it *[xb:file.drives_get()]* in a naming convention to organize the function into a logical "namespace".</p>

<discussion>A background thread uses the YIELD CONTROL command to allow a foreground thread to run. YIELD CONTROL causes the current thread to yield. If there are any other threads waiting to use the CPU, they will be able to do so.

		<description>Without the yield control, the background thread would not relinquish control to the thread_enum() command (and Alpha Anywhere would hang). If your background thread uses THREAD_WAIT() it does not need a yield control since THREAD_WAIT()yeilds an waits for another thread to call THREAD_EVENT(). If your background thread uses socket API calls for streamed file API calls, it doesn't need a YIELD CONTROL because the socket and streamed file calls are preemptive (and return control to the main thread).

<description>Here continue is placed in a for loop. When the program hits continue then it skips back up to the next part of the loop. For example the code
	below is a loop designed to display the numbers 1 through 20. However, the continue statement means that if the number involved is between 10 and 15, then the result should be ignored and the 
	program should keep on counting up.

<example><![CDATA[dim txt as c = ""
for i = 1 to 20
   txt = txt + i + crlf()
next
showvar(txt)   
dim txt as c = ""
for i = 1 to 20
   if 10 <= i .and. i <= 15 then
   	    continue
   end if
   txt = txt + i + crlf()
next
showvar(txt)   ]]></example>

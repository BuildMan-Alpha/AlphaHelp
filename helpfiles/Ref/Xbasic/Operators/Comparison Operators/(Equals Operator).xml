    <description>
        The Equals operator returns .T. (TRUE) if both Operand1 and Operand2 are of the same type and have the same value, i.e.  if the expressions on both sides of the operator are equal.

        <p>When comparing character strings, the Equals operator removes trailing white space and does a case-insensitive comparison. For case-sensitive comparisons that include white space, use the [Exactly Matching Operator].</p>
        <p>You cannot assign the values of a pointer (or dot) variable by using the equals operator. This causes only the addresses of the two pointers to be equal. Use [PROPERTY_RECURSE_ASSIGN()] to assign the values of one pointer variable to another pointer variable.</p>

                The variable receiving the results of a mathematical calculation is always to the left side of the equals operator.

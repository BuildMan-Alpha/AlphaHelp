    <description>This operator concatenates (combines) two character strings into a single new character string. Put another way, The concatenation operator appends Operand2 (a character value) to Operand1. If Operand1 is not a character value, it is automatically converted to a character value before the concatenation operation. In the resulting character string, the entire value stored in the first field is positioned before the value from the second field.</description>

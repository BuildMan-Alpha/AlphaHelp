<description>Package_Name is the name of an Xbasic script in which multiple functions are declared. The IMPORT PACKAGE command makes the functions in Package_Name available in the calling script. Using the IMPORT PACKAGE command has lower overhead than INCLUDING the Package_Name, and it also has fewer size limitations. If the IMPORT PACKAGE command is issued several times, only one copy of the Package_Name script is imported.
Imported scripts can themselves use the IMPORT PACKAGE command. The parent script only sees the functions that it (the parent script) explicitly imports.

<note>The import script is not executed. Only the functions declared in the imported script are imported.</note>

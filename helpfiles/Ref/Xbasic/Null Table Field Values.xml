					<tr><th>Data Type</th><th>Code</th><th>Comment</th></tr>
					<tr><td>Character</td><td>C</td><td>*[xb:= ""]*</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Date</td><td>D</td><td>*[xb:= ctod("")]*</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Numeric</td><td>N</td><td>You cannot distinguish between records that have no value, and those that have a 0 in them. The .DBF table format, which Alpha Five uses, has no concept of a NULL numeric value. *[xb:= 0]*</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Logical</td><td>L</td><td>You cannot distinguish between records that have no value, and those that have a .f. value. *[xb:= .f.]*</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Time</td><td>T</td><td>*[xb:= 00/00/0000 12:00:00 00 am]*</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Short Time</td><td>Y</td><td>*[xb:= 12:00:00 00 am]*</td></tr>

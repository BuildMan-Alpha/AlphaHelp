	<description>LET is used in conjunction with the assignment operator ( = ) to assign the value of an expression to a variable. The use of LET in an assignment operation is optional. This statement is available mostly for compatibility and consistency with the BASIC language, upon which the Xbasic syntax is derived. The equivalent syntax for an assignment statement is:</description>
	<example><![CDATA[Variable_Name = Expression ]]></example>

	<example><![CDATA[let x = COS(y)
let text = "Hello World"
'let is optional, so this also works:
Name = "Simon"]]></example>

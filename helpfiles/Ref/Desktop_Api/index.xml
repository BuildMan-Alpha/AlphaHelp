<p>Most objects in Alpha Anywhere have a collection of methods that let you manipulate the object, or find out
information about that object. For example, a form has a <a href="Objects/Object/OBJECT.NEW_RECORD Method.html"
title="OBJECT.NEW_RECORD Method" class="wiki">&lt;FORM&gt;.NEW_RECORD(</a>) method that adds a new record
to the form.
<p>Xbasic allows you to call the methods of an object. For example, assume you have a form called "Customer".
    To add a new record to this form, you would use this Xbasic statement:</p>

        <example>
:Customer.new_record()

<p>The following Xbasic statements show examples of a method that finds out information about an object and
    other methods that manipulate an object.</p>

        <example>
dim tbl as P
tbl = table.open("customer") 'open the customer table and create a table object called "tbl"
number_of_fields = tbl.fields_get()'the fields_get() method returns information about the tbl object
tbl.enter_begin()  'the enter_begin() method manipulates the tbl object by entering a new record.
tbl.customer = "Alpha Software"
tbl.enter_end(.T.)

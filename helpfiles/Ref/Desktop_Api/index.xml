                <p>Most objects in Alpha Anywhere have a collection of methods that let you manipulate the object, or find out information about that object. For example, a form has a &lt;FORM&gt;.NEW_RECORD() method that adds a new record to the form.</p>
                <p>Xbasic allows you to call the methods of an object. For example, assume you have a form called "Customer". To add a new record to this form, you would use this Xbasic statement:</p>
            </description>
            <example code="xb"><![CDATA[:Customer.new_record()]]></example>

                <p>In general, the syntax for calling a method of an object is:</p>
            </description>
            <example code="xb"><![CDATA[object address.method()]]></example>

            <description>
                <p>The following Xbasic statements show examples of a method that finds out information about an object and other methods that manipulate an object.</p>
            </description>
            <example code="xb"><![CDATA[dim tbl as P
tbl = table.open("customer") 'open the customer table and create a table object called "tbl"
number_of_fields = tbl.fields_get()'the fields_get() method returns information about the tbl object
tbl.enter_begin()  'the enter_begin() method manipulates the tbl object by entering a new record.
tbl.customer = "Alpha Software"
tbl.enter_end(.T.)]]></example>

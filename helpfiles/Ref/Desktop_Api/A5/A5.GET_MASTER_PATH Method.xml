   <description>Returns the path of the Master database, or null if current database is not Network Optimized.</description>
   <discussion>
When you use the Network Optimize command, Alpha Anywhere creates a shadow database on your local computer that is based on a master database on a shared network drive. When you have the shadow database open, the A5.GET_MASTER_PATH() method returns the path of the master database from which the current shadow database was derived.
If the current database is not a shadow database, the function returns a NULL string.
 Note : If you are going to reference a file, you have to add the backslash at the end of the path.

            <description>The following example determines whether the database is a shadow database, then uses this information to determine the path to use to save a report.</description>

    app_path = this_path + chr(92)

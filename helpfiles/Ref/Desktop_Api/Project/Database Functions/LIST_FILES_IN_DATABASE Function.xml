           <case>
             <description>For each table (.dbf), files with the following additional extensions are included in the list: .cdx, .fpt, .ddd, .ddm, and .ddx. These files are included in the list only if they physically exist. For example, a table may have no memo fields, in which case the list will not include a .fpt file.

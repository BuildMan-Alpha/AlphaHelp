               <description>Network Optimization works by making a local copy (also called a shadow copy) on your hard drive of certain of your database application files (such as forms, reports, field rules etc.). When you run the application, Alpha Anywhere accesses these files from your local hard drive, but continues to access the database records from the shared network hard drive. This results in less network traffic, and better performance.
After the master copy of the application has been edited, the local copy must be refreshed. The REFRESH_SHADOW() command updates the local copy of a Network Optimized database.

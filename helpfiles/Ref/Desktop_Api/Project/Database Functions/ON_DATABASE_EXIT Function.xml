The ON_DATABASE_EXIT() function allows you to "register" code that will be executed when the current database is closed. You can call the function as many times as you want to register as many different code snippets as you want.
To delete any code that was previously registered, but is no longer wanted, use the SYSTEM_EVENT_DROP("database_exit", name) command, where name is the sub-property of the p.database_exit variable returned by a call to the SYSTEM_EVENT_DATA_GET()function
The usage of CAN_DATABASE_EXIT() is similar to ON_DATABASE_EXIT(). However, the code that is executed must issue a CANCEL()command in order to prevent the database from closing.

     <description>The A5.GET_PRIVATE_PATH() method returns the current user's local path. This is where the queries that the user runs get stored. This path is defined in the Settings panel. To get to the Settings panel, select View > Settings when the Control Panel has focus.

     <note>If you are going to reference a file, you have to add the backslash at the end of the path.</note>

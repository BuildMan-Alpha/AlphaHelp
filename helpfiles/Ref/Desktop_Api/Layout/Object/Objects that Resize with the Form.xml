<description>Alpha Anywhere allows you to stretch and move form objects as the form is resized. Now you can allow end users to resize forms to increase the size of form fields. The key benefit of this feature is that you can create forms that will look well designed regardless of the screen resolution (e.g. 800 x 600 or 1024 x 768 pixels).</description>

	<title>Setting Anchor Properties Interactively</title>
	<description>After switching to Design view, clicking the Stretch icon [stretch_img] displays the Anchors toolbar. By default, an object is anchored to the top and left (as indicated by the blue bars). Clicking the white bars on the right or bottom anchors the object to the right or bottom, causing it to stretch as the form is resized.
The following picture shows a form in its original format.

		<description>Note the vertical line that shows which elements have been selected. Clicking on Stretch width of selected objects when Form is resized anchors the objects to the right edge of the form. By default, these objects are already anchored to the left and top edges of the form.

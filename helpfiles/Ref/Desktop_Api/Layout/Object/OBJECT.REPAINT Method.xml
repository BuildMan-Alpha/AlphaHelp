            <description><![CDATA[The <OBJECT>.REPAINT() method re-displays a control, browse, or form. 
In some very rare situations, an Alpha Anywhere form may not repaint properly after you perform some action. 
You can now force objects on the form to repaint. For example, if a browse did not repaint properly after you navigated to a new record, the topparent:browse1.repaint() method would repaint the browse object called browse1.

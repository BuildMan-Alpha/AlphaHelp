In some very rare situations, an Alpha Anywhere form may not repaint properly after you perform some action. 
You can now force objects on the form to repaint. For example, if a browse did not repaint properly after you navigated to a new record, the topparent:browse1.repaint() method would repaint the browse object called browse1.

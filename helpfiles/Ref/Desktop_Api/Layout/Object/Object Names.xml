	<topic>Object Names</topic>
<description>An object name must be alphanumeric, can contain ?_', must start with a letter, and must be unique in its container. For example, if a form has two buttons, the buttons must have different names. But if you have two different forms, the buttons on each form can have the same name. Alpha Anywhere will automatically fix object names that break these rules. For example if you open two copies of the Customer form, the objects will be named Customer and CustomerN (where N is an additional character that makes the name unique, e.g. Customer1).</description>

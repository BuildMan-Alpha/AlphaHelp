            <description><![CDATA[The <OBJECT>.CHANGE_MODE()puts a layout into change mode, just as if the user had done so by beginning to type into any editable field. The method returns the mode of the layout. If the command succeeded, then the return value is "CHANGE". If the command failed, perhaps because a form's "restrict-change" property was turned, on, or the form was already in enter mode, then "VIEW" or "ENTER" is returned.

    <syntax>Browse.SaveAs as C ( Layout_Name as C [, Format as C [, Filter_Expression as C [, Order_Expression as C [, Output_Filename as C [, Open_Application as L [, PrintOptions as P [, Arguments as SQL::Arguments [, Options as P ]]]]]]]] )

        <p>If you specify an optional *[xb:Filter_Expression]*, the only records matching the filter are printed. (In addition to the filter specified here, the layout may have a filter defined within the layout definition).</p>
        <p>The layout is printed to *[xb:Output_Filename]*. If *[xb:Output_Filename]* is not specified, the layout is printed to a file with the same name as the *[xb:Layout_Name]* in the same folder as the database.</p>
        <p>For more information and detailed description of parameters, see [Report.SaveAs Function].</p>

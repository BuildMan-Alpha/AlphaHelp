	<topic>uiFreezeObject.create Function</topic>
	<description>An object that allows you to stop screen redrawing. The UIFreezeObject should beinstantiated using a local variable and not a shared or global variable. When an error occurs, the script stops executing. When the script stops, the local variable frame goes away, and the reference to the UIFreezeObject goes away, and as a result, the screen is no longer frozen.</description>

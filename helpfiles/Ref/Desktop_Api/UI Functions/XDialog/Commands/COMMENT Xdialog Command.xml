	<note>It is easy to add comments to the body of an Xdialog. You just type any comment as you would in a script, by starting the line with a single quote. The single quote must be the first character on the line, and the Xdialog body must include the {removecomments} command on a line by its self. For example:</note>

	<example><![CDATA[ui_dlg_box("test",<<%dlg%
{removecomments}
'This is a comment - it won't show up because of the \
{removecomments} command;
{lf};
Name: [.20Name];
{lf};
<10OK> <10Cancel>;
%dlg%)]]></example>

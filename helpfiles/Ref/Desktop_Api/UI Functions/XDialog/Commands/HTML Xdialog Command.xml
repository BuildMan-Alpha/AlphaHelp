	<description>This dialog show how you can render HTML in an Xdialog using Alpha Anywhere built-in HTML control. The built-in control is much faster than loading the Internet Explorer ActiveX control. When you use the built-in HTML control you can define and respond to click events in the HTML using standard Xdialog sntax.</description>

	<description>This is a DIV. If you view the HTML source for this DIV, you will see that the 'a5:onclick' attribute defines what Xbasic to execute when the user clicks on the DIV. 
Notice that in order to make this DIV respond to the click event it was necessary to add a class to the DIV that set the 'behavior' CSS attribute to 'clickable'. If you don't do this, the DIV will not respond to the click event. You will notice that in the HEAD section of the HTML we define a class called '.clickable' that sets the 'behavior' attribute. This 'class' attribute of this div includes the 'clickable' class.

	<description>Here is an image control that displays an internal Alpha Anywhere image. Notice that you can click on the image. In order to make the button 'clickable' it is necessary to set the class of the imge to 'clickable', just as was necessary for DIV elements.

<example><![CDATA[ %html% dim dlg_title as c 
dim dlg_body as c 
dim dlg_event as c 
dlg_title = "HTML Layout - Click Events" 
dlg_body = <<%dlg% {html=100,20html}; 
%dlg% dlg_event = <<%code% 
if a_dlg_button = "event1" 
then a_dlg_button = "" ui_msg_box("Hello","You clicked on the second DIV.") 
end if 
if a_dlg_button = "event2" 
then a_dlg_button = "" ui_msg_box("Hello","You clicked on the button. 
Notice that we did not have to set the button to be clickable, like we did for a DIV. 
Buttons are automatically clickable.") 
end if 
if a_dlg_button = "event3" 
then a_dlg_button = "" ui_msg_box("Hello","You clicked on the Image.") 
end if %code% ui_dlg_box(dlg_title,dlg_body,dlg_event)]]></example>

	<description>Here is how the same Xdialog would be created using the older {CONDITION} command:</description>
	<example><![CDATA[a = .f. 
b = .f. 
c = .f.
  
ui_dlg_box("",<<%dlg% 
(a) A; 
{condition_begin=a} 
(b) B \(requires A is true); 
{condition=a.and.b} 
(c) \(C requires A and B are true); 
{condition=a.and.b.and.c} 
This is 3 conditions deep \(requires A, B and C are true); 
{condition=.t.} 
This is at the top level \(does not require that A is true);

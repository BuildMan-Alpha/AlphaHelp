	<description>When you use the Xdialog Genie to design an Xdialog box, you have the option saving the settings that you define in the Genie. These settings are saved in the current database's dictionary (i.e. the databasename.alb file).
The last step when using the Xdialog Genie is to insert the dialog box that you have just defined into the script that you are currently editing. You can either insert the Xbasic code for the dialog box into the script, or you can insert a reference to the saved Xdialog settings into the code.

  <discussion>If the 'checkbox' column in the Grid has been turned on, executes a search on the Grid that returns the checked records. This is useful if you want to perform some subsequent action on just the checked records, such as printing a report, or exporting data to Excel. Once you have performed a filter on the checked rows, you can export the curently selected records, or print the currently selected records. </discussion>

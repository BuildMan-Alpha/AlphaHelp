  <topic>{grid.object}.getRowsInGrid Method</topic>
  <description>Returns the number of rows in the current page of the grid. This is not the same as the number of rows in the Grid query. </description>

  <discussion>
    <p>The {grid.object}.getRowsInGrid() method replaced the internal ._rowsInGrid property. When users were using the internal ._rowsInGrid property to get the number of rows in the current page, but this value includes rows that have been deleted.</p>
    <p>For example, say that the Grid is set to show 10 rows per page and that the refresh method is set to 'Auto' and that a minimal refresh is done after update, insert and delete operations. If the user deletes a row from the Grid, the ._rowsInGrid property will still be 10, because the deleted row is not really deleted from the current page - it is just hidden and marked as deleted.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the {grid.object}.getRowsInGrid() method will return 9.</p>

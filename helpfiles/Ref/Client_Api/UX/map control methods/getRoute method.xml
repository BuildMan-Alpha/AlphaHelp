            <description>The route object has the following structure:</description>
            <example><![CDATA[{
	start: '', \\starting point
	end: '', \\ending point
	waypoints: {
		original: [], \\waypoints in original order
		plotted: [], \\waypoints in plot order
		order: [] \\array showing numeric index of each plotted waypoint (if the waypoint order has been optimized)

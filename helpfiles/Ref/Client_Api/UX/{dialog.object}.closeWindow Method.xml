    <description>Closes a window.</description>

    <syntax>{dialog.Object}.closeWindow(UXWindowName)</syntax>

    <arguments>
        <argument>
            <name>UXWindowName</name>
            <description>The explicit name for the window specified in the window's properites.</description>
        </argument>
    </arguments>

    <note>You cannot use this method if you did not give the window an explicit name when you defined it. In that case you will need to use the A5.windows.getFromElement(ele) function, where 'ele' is the Id of some element in the window.</note>
    <note>Do not confuse this method with the {dialog.Object}.closeContainerWindow(ele) method which is used to close the window in which a UX component is shown. For example if a component has a button that shows a UX component in a window then a button on the child UX can close the window in which the child UX is shown using the .closeContainerWindow() method.</note>
    <note>If the window you are trying to close is a 'Container Window' (i.e. a window that was defined in a UX component using a 'Container' control with a sub-type of 'Window') you can use the {dialog.object}.hideContainerWindow(WindowContainerName) method, passing in the name of the container.</note>

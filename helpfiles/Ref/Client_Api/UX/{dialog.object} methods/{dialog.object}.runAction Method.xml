            <title>Passing in a Pointer to an Element</title>
            <description>Some actions, such as opening a window in a dropdown or a window that is positioned relative to another control, require additional information provided by passing an element to the *[js:{dialog.object}.runAction]* method. You can pass the *[js:this]* pointer to the method to accomplish the task:</description>
            <example><![CDATA[{dialog.object}.runAction('openUX',this);]]></example>

        <section>
            <description>You can also pass in a different element in your component. For example, suppose you wanted the popup window to appear relative to a List control when the action is invoked:</description>
            <example><![CDATA[//Get a pointer to the list control
var ele = {dialog.object}.getPointer('LIST1');

// Run the action
{dialog.object}.runAction('openUX', ele);]]></example>

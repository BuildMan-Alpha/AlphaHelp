        <p>This method allows you to check for a new Instant Update version of an application without having to exit the App on the device and then re-launch it.</p>
        <p>The method is only available in a PhoneGap application that was build with the Instant Update feature enabled.</p>
        <p>Normally, after you publish an Instant Update to a PhoneGap application, users will not get the new version until they re-launch the application on their devices.</p>
        <p>Using this method, you can get a new version of the application without have to exit and re-launch the application.</p>

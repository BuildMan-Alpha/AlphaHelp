        <description>The logical row number of a row in a Repeating Section and its physical row number are the same, unless rows have been deleted from the Repeating Section. When a row is deleted from a Repeating Section it is not really deleted, it is only hidden.
So, for example, assume that a Repeating Section had 5 rows to start with and then the first three rows were deleted. There would now be two visible rows, (logical row number 1 and 2), but the physical row numbers for these two rows would be 4 and 5. In order to set focus to the last visible row in the Repeating Section (logical row 2, but physical row 5) you can use the .setRepeatingSectionActiveLogicalRow() method.

           <description>This is more convenient than having to first call the ._repeatingSectionLogicalToPhysicalRow() to convert the logical row number to a physical row number, and then calling the .setRepeatingSectionActiveRow() method.

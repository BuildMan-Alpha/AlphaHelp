        <p>The .deselectAll() method deselects rows in the List and, if the List has child Lists with [pre-fetched data], deselects rows in all child Lists. The Detail View for the List (and the Detail View for any child Lists with pre-fetched data) is also disabled (if the '[No record in List selected]' property for the top-most parent List is set to '*[ui:DisableDetailView]*').</p>
        <p>Contrast this method with the low level [._deselectAll()] method which also deselects any selected rows in a List, but does not perform any action on child Lists or the associated Detail View that the List may have.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>

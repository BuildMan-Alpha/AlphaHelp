    <description>Returns an array of all of the controls in the Detail View. Only controls that actually exit are returned. For example, say you specified that the Detail View is all of the controls in a container called 'CONTAINER_1' and one of the controls in this container is called 'SHIPPING_ADDRESS', but the List does not have a field called 'SHIPPING_ADDRESS'. The array of controls returned by this function will not include the 'SHIPPING_ADDRESS' control.</description>

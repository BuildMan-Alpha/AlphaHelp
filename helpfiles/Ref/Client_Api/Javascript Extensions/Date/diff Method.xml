	<arguments>
		<argument optional="true" >
			<name>scope</name>
			<types><type>string</type><type>array</type></types>
			<description>The scope of difference. This can be "years", "months", "weeks", "days", "hours", "minutes" and/or "seconds". If an array is passed in, the returned object will divide the difference between the scope units. A string with a "-" separating two units will output all units between and including the two specified, for example "weeks-hours" would output "weeks", "days" and "hours".</description>
		</argument>
		<argument optional="true" >
			<name>date</name>
			<types><type>string</type><type>date</type><type>array</type></types>
			<description>The date to compare the given date with. If no value is passed in the date will be compared to the current date.</description>
		</argument>
		<argument optional="true" >
			<name>format</name>
			<type>string</type>
			<description>If the passed in date is a string, this will specify the format the date is in. If no format is specified the default format in A5.d.date.format will be used. See *[link:Date.toFormat]* for a full list of format values.</description>

<p>
The Date.diff method returns the difference between the date variable and another date.
</p>
<p>
The scope controls what difference values are returned.
If a scope (such as "years") is not present then that scope will not be included.
This means that if "years" is excluded, but "months" is included, and the difference in the dates is more then a year, the "months" will be greater than 12.
</p>
<p>
Multiple scopes must be defined in the correct order - i.e. "years", "months", "weeks", "days", "hours", "minutes" and "seconds".
If no scope is specified, the scope is set to "days", "hours", and "minutes".

var d = new Date(2018,7,10);
var d2 = new Date(2018,8,5,12,30,20,100);
var dif = d.diff('months-days');
// dif = {months: 0, weeks: 3, days: 5, before: true}
dif = d.diff(['days','minutes'],d2);
// {days: 26, minutes: 750, before: true}
dif = d.diff('hours',d2);
// dif = {hours: 636, before: true}</example>

        <p>If a control is changed by user action, the event handlers created by A5.form.prepare() will set the control "dirty" when the user leaves the control However, often a control value is changed by some other action, such as a Javascript action on the page, an action such as a lookup or date picker.  If the list of 'dirty' controls is important for some action, every changed control must be set 'dirty' or it won't be listed. If the user didn't directly change the value, the "dirty" attribute won't be set.  This function allows setting a control 'dirty'.  If a control has an ID value of "newdate", this Javascript function call will set the 'a5isdirty' attribute to "True".</p>

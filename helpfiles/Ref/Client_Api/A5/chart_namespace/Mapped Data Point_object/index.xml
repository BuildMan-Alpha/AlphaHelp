	<description> The mapping of raw data into a point.</description>
	<discussion>
<p>
A data point is an object made up of the explicitly named "src" property and each named dimension (see *[link:A5.chart Map Object]* dimensions) as an additional property.
For instance, if a "rect" chart was being created, the data point would have "src", "x" and "y" as defined properties.
Discrete dimensions will be stored as a string value.
Continuous dimensions will be stored as an object. See *[link:A5.chart Mapped Data Point Dimension Object]*.

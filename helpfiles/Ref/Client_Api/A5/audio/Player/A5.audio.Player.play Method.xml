	<prototype>A5.audio.Player.play()</prototype>
	<description> Play the audio. This will start audio playing from the current time.</description>
	<note> On some devices audio playback cannot be started programatically and the A5.audio.Player.play() method must therefore be called from the context of a user event, such as "onclick" or "ontouchstart".</note>

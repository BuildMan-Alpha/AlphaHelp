	<description> Play the audio. This will start audio playing from the current time. If the current time is at the end of the audio, audio will start playing from the beginning.</description>
	<note> On some devices audio playback cannot be started programatically and the A5.audio.Player.play() method must therefore be called from the context of a user event, such as "onclick" or "ontouchstart".</note>

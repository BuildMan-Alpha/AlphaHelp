<p>
A panel's size can be bound to one of three types.
Not binding a panel's size will mean that the panel will be sized programmatically.
A binding type of "self" means that any time the panel element is resized (such as if the panel was the body of an A5.Window) the panel will be resized.
A binding type of "parent" means that any time the panel's parent element is resized (such as if the panel was the only child of the body of an A5.Window) the panel will be resized.
A binding type of "window" means that the panel will be sized to match the browser windows size, and any time the browser is resized, the panel will be resized.

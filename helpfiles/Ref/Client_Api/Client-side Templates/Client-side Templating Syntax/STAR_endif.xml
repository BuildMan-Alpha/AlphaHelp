   <description>Closes a conditional command.</description>

    <section>
        <description>The {*endif} command closes a conditional section if it contains a {*if logicalExpression}, 
            {*elseif logicalExpression}, and {*else}. For example, consider the following data in the Template Tester:
</description>
         <example code="cstemplate"><![CDATA[{
    employees: [
        {firstname: 'Fred', lastname: 'Smith', state: 'MA'},
        {firstname: 'Laura', lastname: 'Linneker', state: 'CA'},
        {firstname: 'Junior', lastname: 'Programmer', state: 'MA'},
        {firstname: 'Bill', lastname: 'Lindsey', state: 'NY'}
    ]
}]]></example>
    </section>
    <section>
        <description>And say you have the following template with the different conditional commands.</description>
         <example code="cstemplate"><![CDATA[{employees}
    Employee name: {firstname}{lastname}<br>
    <div>
        {*if state=='MA'}
            Employee is based in MA
        {*elseif state=='CA'}
            Employee is based in CA
        {*else}
            Employee is not based in MA or CA
        {*endif}
    </div><br>
{/employees}]]></example>
        
    </section>
     <section>
        <description>This returns the following results:</description>
         <example code="cstemplate"><![CDATA[Employee name: FredSmith
Employee is based in MA

Employee name: LauraLinneker
Employee is based in CA

Employee name: JuniorProgrammer
Employee is based in MA

Employee name: BillLindsey
Employee is not based in MA or CA]]></example>
        
    </section>
        <section>
        <description>Without the {*else} statement the template would look like this:</description>
         <example code="cstemplate"><![CDATA[{employees}
    Employee name: {firstname}{lastname}<br>
    <div>
        {*if state=='MA'}
            Employee is based in MA
        {*elseif state=='CA'}
            Employee is based in CA
        {*else}
            Employee is not based in MA or CA
    </div><br>
{/employees}]]></example>
        
    </section>
        </section>
        <section>
        <description>And return a result that doesn't actually execute the conditional commands but, rather, 
            treats them like a regular string.</description>
         <example code="cstemplate"><![CDATA[Employee name: FredSmith
{*if state=='MA'} Employee is based in MA {*elseif state=='CA'} Employee is based in CA {*else} Employee is not based in MA or CA

Employee name: LauraLinneker
{*if state=='MA'} Employee is based in MA {*elseif state=='CA'} Employee is based in CA {*else} Employee is not based in MA or CA

Employee name: JuniorProgrammer
{*if state=='MA'} Employee is based in MA {*elseif state=='CA'} Employee is based in CA {*else} Employee is not based in MA or CA

Employee name: BillLindsey
{*if state=='MA'} Employee is based in MA {*elseif state=='CA'} Employee is based in CA {*else} Employee is not based in MA or CA]]></example>

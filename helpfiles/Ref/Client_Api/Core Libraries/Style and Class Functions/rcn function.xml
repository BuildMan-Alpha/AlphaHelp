<prototype>$rcn(ELEMENT as element/string/array of ELEMENTs, CLASSNAME as string)
</prototype>
<description>
The $rcn() function removes the class name from the passed-in element(s). This will only remove the specified class name. You might want to use this to remove some temporary styling to an element, such as a focus, or error style. This function is typically used after the $acn() function has been used to add a class name to an element.</description>
<example>
/*Assume that you previously added the 'inputError' class name to an element to indicate that a validation error had occurred. Now, assume that the user has
corrected the error and you want to remove the 'inputError' class name from the element. */
$rcn('firstname','inputError');
 
/*Remove a class name from multiple elements.*/
$rcn(['firstname','lastname','address','city','state','zip'],'inputError');
</example>
            <important>Use *[link:{dialog.object}.getPointer()@ux component getpointer method]* to get the DOM element for a control.</important>

        <p>Many developers like to create 'clean' HTML that does not have any JavaScript events embedded in the HTML. This provides a nice separation between the HTML layout and the behavior of the HTML page.</p>
        <p>The functions in this section describe how you can use JavaScript to attach (i.e. bind) JavaScript code to the various element events in your HTML page.</p>
        <p>This methodology is often referred to as 'unobtrusive' JavaScript because the JavaScript which controls the HTML does not clutter up the HTML markup and is kept separate from the HTML.</p>

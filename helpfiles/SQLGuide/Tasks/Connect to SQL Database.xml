					<description>The Connect to SQL Database action allows you define a connection to a SQL database (including Excel). Alpha Anywhere will use AlphaDAO (the Alpha Anywhere Data Access Objects) to connect to the remote database. You can connect to any database for which Alpha Anywhere has native drivers, or for which an ODBC driver is available. Once you have opened a connection to the SQL database, you can execute other actions that select, update, insert, and delete records in the SQL database.</description>

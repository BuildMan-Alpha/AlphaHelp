  <discussion>Force all client-side computations (calculated fields, show/hide expression, enable expression, etc). to be recomputed. Client-side calculations are also known as 'watch events'. In effect, this method forces all watch events to fire. Generally, this should not be necessary as the Dialog will automatically be recalculated when necessary. However, there may be situations where a watch event would not normally fire, but you want to force it to fire.

For example, say you have a watch event that is watching the value in a textbox control. The watch event will fire when the textbox control is blurred (i.e. loses focus). Say you want the event to fire after every keystroke, rather than having to wait until the control is blurred. You could use this method on the control's onKeyUp event to force the watch events to fire. {dialog.Object}.refreshClientSideComputations();</discussion>

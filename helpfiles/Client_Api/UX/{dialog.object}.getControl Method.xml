  <discussion><![CDATA[Get a pointer to a control, such as a slider, date picker, map, etc. so that you can call methods of the object, or set properties of the object. 
NOTE: Only controls that are implemented as Javascript objects are returned. For example, a slider control is implemented as a Javascript object. A standard HTML text box control, on the other hand is not implemented as a Javascript object -- it is just a standard HTML <input> control. If you call the .getControl() method on a textbox control, the method will return false. However, if you set certain properties on the textbox control (such as watermark, client-side formatting, mask etc) then a special 'helper' object is created for the textbox control and then the getControl() method will return a pointer to this helper object.]]>

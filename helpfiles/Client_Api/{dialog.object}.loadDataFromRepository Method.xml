  <discussion>Loads data that was previously saved to the Repository. The component is populated with the data that was saved to the Repository. The 'afterLoadFromRepository' client-side event fires after the event has completed. 
If he optional flagDelete parameter is true, then the Repository entry is deleted after it has been read.

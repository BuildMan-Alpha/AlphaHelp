  <discussion>Allows you to show/hide an element on the page. If the element is currently hidden, it is shown, and vice versa. When the element is shown/hidden, it is animated. If the second argument is blank, the default animation style is 'slide' and the duration is 200 milliseconds. The animationObject can have an optional property called 'onComplete' which is a callback function to execute when the animation is complete.

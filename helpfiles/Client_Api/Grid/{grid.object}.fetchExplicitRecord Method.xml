   <description>Adds a specified record to the Grid as the last record on the page.</description>
  
  <discussion>Makes an AJAX callback and retrieves the record identified by the primaryKeyValue and then adds that record to the Grid as the last record on the page. Typically used with read-only Grids. If the primary key for the table the Grid is based on is composed of multiple fields, primarykeyValue should be a '|||' (3 pipes) delimited list of values.

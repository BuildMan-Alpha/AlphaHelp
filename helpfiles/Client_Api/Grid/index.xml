    <description>Properties and methods that can be used on the client side to automate grid components.</description>
    <properties>
        <property><name>{Grid.ChildComponentName}</name><description>For use in the case when you are opening a child Grid in a pop-up Ajax window.
Gets replaced with the alias of the child Grid Component.</description></property>
        <property><name>{Grid.ChildObject}</name><description>For use in the case when you are opening a child Grid in a pop-up Ajax window.
Gets replaced with the name of the Javascript Grid Component Object for the child Grid that is opened in a pop-up Ajax window. Use this placeholder when you want to call a method of the child Grid Object. e.g. {Grid.ChildObject}.sort(2), to sort the Grid on column 2.</description></property>
        <property><name>{Grid.ComponentName}</name><description>Gets replaced with the alias of the Grid Component. For example, if the Grid alias is 'GRID1', then is replaced with 'GRID1'.</description></property>
        <property><name>{Grid.ControlIdEscaped}</name><description>The control Id of the control. Special characters in the id are Javascript escaped. You must use this placeholder (and not {Grid.ControlId}) if you want to use this placeholder in a selector (such as JQuery - jQuery('#{Grid.controlIDEscaped}') )</description></property>
        <property><name>{Grid.ControlId}</name><description>The control Id of the control. Note: See comment on {Grid.ControlIDEscaped}.</description></property>
        <property><name>{grid.Object}.isDirty</name><description>Returns true if the Grid (either Grid part or Detail View part) is dirty (i.e. record has been edited, but not yet saved).</description></property>
        <property><name>{Grid.object}</name><description>Gets replaced with the name of the Javascript Grid Component Object. For example, if the Grid alias is 'GRID1', then is replaced with 'GRID1_GridObj'. Use this placeholder when you want to call a method of the Grid Object. e.g. {Grid.Object}.sort(2), to sort the Grid on column 2.</description></property>
        <property><name>{Grid.RowID}</name><description>Gets replaced with the row number of the Grid in which the Javascript is inserted. For new record rows, the 'NEWROW' prefix is used (e.g. for the first new record row - 'NEWROW1'). Used in constructing Javascript object names where the use of a - sign would result in an invalid object name.</description></property>
        <property><name>{Grid.RowNumber}</name><description>Gets replaced with the row number of the Grid in which the Javascript is inserted. For new record rows, negative numbers are used. For example, the 2nd new record row is -2.</description></property>
        <property><name>{Grid.Style}</name><description>Gets replaced with the style name of the Grid. For example, if the style is 'GlassOlive', then gets replaced with 'GlassOlive'.</description></property>
    </properties>

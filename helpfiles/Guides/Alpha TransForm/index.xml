        <p>You do not need an Alpha Anywhere license to build applications against the TransForm API, however there are several features in Alpha Anywhere that make it easy to build mobile and web applications that integrate with TransForm.</p>
        <p>Alpha Anywhere can be used to create complementary applications that integrate with your Alpha TransForm account. While Alpha TransForm's API is built to be used with any application, Alpha Anywhere's helper features make it easier to build mobile, web, or desktop applications.</p>

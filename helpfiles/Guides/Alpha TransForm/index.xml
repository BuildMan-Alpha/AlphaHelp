    <discussion>
        <p> TransForm is a stand-alone service for building mobile data collection forms (i.e. apps). To use TransForm you do not need an Alpha Anywhere license, but if you also have Alpha Anywhere, there are several features in Alpha Anywhere that make working with TransForm easier.

        <p>Alpha Anywhere can be used to create complementary applications that integrate with your Alpha TransForm account. While Alpha TransForm's API is built to be used with any application, Alpha Anywhere's helper features make it easier to build mobile, web, or desktop applications.</p>

		The component requires the user to login using the Alpha Security Framework and upon successful login, a private push notification is sent to an administrative app user. A map is then displayed, allowing the user to login to a specific location. A typical use case might be a service technician checking in to a job site. When the user checks in, the device's lat/lon is reverse geocoded (using Google's geocoding API) and the location address is sent via a push notification to an administrative user.

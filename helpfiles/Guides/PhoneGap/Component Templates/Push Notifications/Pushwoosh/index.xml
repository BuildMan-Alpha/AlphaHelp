		The component requires user login using the Alpha Securtiy Framework and upon successful login, a private push notification is sent to a administrative app user and a map is displayed, allowing the user to login to a specific location. A typical use case might be a service technician checking in to a job site. When the user checks in, the device's lat/lon is reverse geocoded (using Google geocoding API) and the location is sent via a push notification to a specific administrative user.

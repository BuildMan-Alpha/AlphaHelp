    <topic>Audio Player and Audio Player/Recorder control doesn't work on iOS 12.2</topic>
    <description>The recent iOS 12.2 update changed the way media files are handled in the PhoneGap web view. In order for the UX Audio Player and Audio Player/Recorder controls to work with iOS 12.2, the iOS *[ui:Media Playback Requires User Action]* property must be disabled in the PhoneGap configuration.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>Beginning with Alpha Anywhere build 5771, the *[ui:Media Playback Requires User Action]* property will be disabled by default.</p>
        <p>To change this setting in existing projects, check the *[ui:Show Advanced Options]* property in the PhoneGap App Builder Genie.</p>

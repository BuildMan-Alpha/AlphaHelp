            <description>
                <p>The PhoneGap App Builder loads all of the core PhoneGap plugins from the NPM registry. If you are using any of the CLI versions of PhoneGap, the NPM core plugins are required.</p>
                <p>All 3rd party plugins list the registry where they can be found. Plugins in Alpha Anywhere are either sourced from NPM or GitHub. This information can be found in the help for each plugin from within the PhoneGap Builder properties.</p>

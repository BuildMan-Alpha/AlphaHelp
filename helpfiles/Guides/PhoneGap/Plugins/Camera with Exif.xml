    <description>Capture Exif and geolocation information when the user takes a photo or uploads a photo from the Photo Library with the Camera With Exif PhoneGap Plugin.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The Camera With Exif PhoneGap plugin, developed by Alpha Software, is a modified version of the cordova-plugin-camera that provides the addition of the EXIF and geolocation metadata to all camera and gallery images and returns this metadata along with the image file URI to the success callback. This allows the image metadata to be stored to a database along with the image or the image file reference. The metadata does not need to be parsed from the image itself because it is included in the success callback.</p>
        <p>See *[extlink:GitHub: cordova-plugin-camera-with-exif@https://github.com/remoorejr/cordova-plugin-camera-with-exif]* for the full documentation. </p>

				<p>While Alpha Anywhere includes the ability to add most of the major PhoneGap plugins to any project from within the PhoneGap App Builder, the list of available PhoneGap plugins is extensive and dynamic. You may find that you need to use a PhoneGap plugin that is not listed in the PhoneGap App Builders' 3rd Party Plugins section. With the User Included Plugin Manager, you can build a library of user included plugins for use within any Alpha Anywhere PhoneGap App. It's easy to add any PhoneGap plugin that you'd like to use with the User Included Plugin Manager. </p>

    <title>Multiple App Icons</title>
<description>If you have a lot of applications in PhoneGap build, retrieving the app icon for each app can be slow; because the PhoneGap build API does not have a call to retrieve all of the icons at once. You then have to call the API once for each app. Setting the Get Icon Timeout Threshold property to , will cause a default icon to be used. </description>

      <description>This is the recommended setting on Android to ensure the files are contained within the app folder and that the files are deleted when the app is deleted. Under iOS, the files are always in the app folder, however, files in the Library folder are not available to iTunes nor are they synchronized to iCloud.

When "Compatibility" mode is set as the persistent file location for an Android PhoneGap app:</description>

    <description>In general "Compatibility" mode is NOT the recommended setting.

If you have used the PhoneGap file plug-in the default setting will make your app files inaccessible. The setting will not change for existing PhoneGap apps because the "Compatibility" setting will remain within the configuration file. Your app will only be affected if you delete the previous PhoneGap project and create a new one. You can change this setting by enabling Show Advanced Options in the Configuration Options settings of the PhoneGap App Builder Genie. Once the Show Advanced Options is enabled, you can change the persistent file location as required.

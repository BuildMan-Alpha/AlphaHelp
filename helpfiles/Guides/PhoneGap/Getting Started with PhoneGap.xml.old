                    <description>Alpha Anywhere is a comprehensive HTML5 development framework that on it's own can build powerful mobile HTML5 web applications that look and feel like native apps. Once created, a web application on a mobile device is launched within the web browser that is supplied with the device. iOS devices typically use Mobile Safari, while Android devices can use a variety of browsers with Chrome or some derivative of Chrome typically being the native browser. Since the app is running within the browser, it is limited to the capabilities that the browser exposes.</description>

                    <description>You will use the Alpha Anywhere IDE to develop a base UX component that may contain all of the code and data that is required for your Cordova application, or you may choose to create a base UX component that loads data and additional components from a remote server (assuming the phone or tablet has Internet access).</description>

                        <p>Alpha Anywhere includes two options for building Cordova apps: Ionic Appflow or Cordova CLI.</p>

                        <p>Ionic Appflow is a cloud-based service that allows you to build Cordova apps for iOS or Android. It has the same ease of use as PhoneGap Build and does not require any extra hardware (i.e., a Mac.)</p>
                        <p>To build iOS or Android apps, developers publish application updates to a GitHub project connected to Ionic Appflow. Ionic Appflow automatically creates a new version of your application when a change is detected. When your app is ready to ship, you can publish directly to the Google Play and Apple App stores.</p>
                        <p>Alpha Anywhere works with Ionic Appflow by generating the application build files to publish GitHub. You will need a GitHub account and, at a minimum, a paid Ionic Appflow Launch account.</p>

                        <p>Cordova CLI provides a command-line interface for creating iOS and Android applications. It is supported on Mac and Windows and requires installing Cordova CLI and the native app development tools for your target platform(s).</p>
                        <p>Alpha Anywhere works with Cordova CLI to create an Xcode or Android Studio project used to build a native mobile application for iOS or Android, respectively. Alpha Anywhere packages your application files and a script that describes the required plugins and resources needed to build the mobile app. The script is run with Cordova CLI to create the Xcode or Android Studio project. The generated project can then be opened in Xcode or Android Studio to build, test, and deploy your application to the iOS or Android app stores.</p>
                        <p>Cordova CLI offers the most flexibility for building cross-platform mobile iOS and Android applications. While PhoneGap Build and Ionic Appflow are built on Apache Cordova, these services only allow you to test your app on a phone or tablet. When created with Cordova CLI, you gain access to device emulators and a wide range of tools for testing your iOS and Android applications before deploying them to physical devices. It takes a little time to become familiar with the Cordova CLI process, but it's worth the effort.</p>

                        <p>In this guide, we'll demonstrate building an Android App using Cordova CLI. Cordova CLI doesn't require any extra accounts with third-party services.</p>
                        <p>To follow along, you'll need to setup Cordova CLI on your development machine. *[extlink:Follow the instructions here@https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/documentation/index?search=phonegap%20cli%20builder]* to get Cordova CLI setup. Return to this guide when you're done.</p>

                    <description>It is assumed that you are familiar with Alpha Anywhere and know how to build a UX component for a mobile device. You should already be familiar with the concepts of a Panel Navigator, Panels, Buttons controls, etc. If you are not familiar with these terms, it would be best for you to work through a number of the tutorials available prior to attempting to build Cordova apps with Alpha Anywhere. </description>

                    <description>To verify you've got everything setup and working properly, we're going to build a very simple Cordova app that contains a Panel and a button that when tapped, initiates a native beep tone. This will work on both Android and iOS devices. We will build the test UX component, generate a Cordova app from that component, and finally, install the app on an Android device (or Android emulator).</description>
                    <note>Installation on an iOS device requires that you setup an Apple iOS Developer Account. This will be covered in a later chapter.</note>

                    <description>The Cordova App Builder will generate all of the required app icons for the targeted platforms at all required sizes and resolutions for each. The app icon is the icon that is installed and displayed on the devices home screen.</description>

                    <description>When building your own app icons, you should build the largest size that is required by all of the targeted devices. A 144px x 144px icon is the largest required for iOS and Android devices. If you were building for Windows Phone 8, a 173px x 173px icon would be best. </description>

                    <description>Since Alpha Anywhere is generating all of the required icons from the one icon selected, it's best to generate images that are smaller in size from a larger icon as this preserves the image resolution, eliminating pixelation of the smaller image. The same is true when generating the app splash screens, which you can leave blank for this test application.</description>

                    <description>In this example, the Allow Access Origin property is set to * which will allow your app to access all other URL's on the Internet. The app doesn't actually require setting the Allow Access Origin property, however it is a common requirement to load data from other web services, the Alpha Anywhere Application Server, or possibly to load a web page in the inApp Web Browser. If the URL is not specified in the Allowed Access Origin Property, the request will be blocked. This is a common point of failure so you need to be aware of this setting from the first app you publish. </description>

                    <description>Native Alert calls the PhoneGap navigator.notification.alert function, which displays a native alert dialog as opposed to a browser "alert" dialog. On iOS devices you will notice the dialog title does not contain the referencing page (which in this case will be index.html). A callback function is supported and is called when the user closes the alert dialog. In this case, the callback function displays a standard javaScript alert dialog. You will most certainly notice a difference between the native alert dialog and the JavaScript alert dialog on an iOS device. On an Android device, there is little difference.</description>

Similar to an Alert in many ways, the confirm dialog adds the ability to display two (2) buttons and passes the one based index number (1 or 2, instead of a typical zero based array, which passes 0 and 1) in the callback when a button is pressed.</description>

                    <description>Scan and Search iTunes calls the PhoneGap barcodescanner third party plugin which calls the cordova.plugins.barcodescanner.Scan function. This  function will bring up a barcode scanner which uses the devices camera and some very clever image processing software to allow you to scan in a barcode  from the back of most any book and return the results to a success (or fail) callback function. </description>

                    <description>In  the example component, the success callback function makes a client side call to Apple's iTunes Search API where the text result of the barcode scan is submitted to iTunes Search for an ISBN lookup. If the ISBN from the book is available within iTunes, the descriptive and pricing information will be displayed on a second PanelCard that will perform a slide transition into view. </description>

                    <description>Help Button navigates to a third panel that will display application help. The help content is contained within a freeform HTML control, that initially contains an empty div. When the app is fired up, the client side onInitializeComplete event is used to populate the div with the help HTML, which is defined in the JavaScript Functions of the component.  This technique is one I prefer because it allows the definition of the components HTML content to be centralized and not tied to a specific control.</description>

As with most everything in programming, there are a lot of different ways to accomplish something.

The techniques I've used are what I consider best practice.</description>

                    <description>As you will see later on,  I've written the JavaScript to interact with the third party plugins for the Flashlight and the Bar Code Scanner used by this component. Keep in mind that by referring to the PhoneGap documentation, and writing a little bit of JavaScript, you can do anything with Alpha Anywhere and PhoneGap today.</description>

                    <description>First a check is made  for the existence of the window.plugins object (which the Flashlight plugin JavaScript files create) and if the object is not defined, an alert is displayed and the function returns. This will prevent an error in the app and allows you to test the component in Working Preview. This technique is used throughout the button event handlers.</description>

                    <description>Next, take a look at the abstract onclick event handler for the Scanner button. Here the scanBarCode function is called. This function is also defined in the component's JavaScript Functions. </description>

                <section>
                    <description>The scanBarCode function does a quick check for the cordova object. If this object does not exist then either we are not running within PhoneGap on a mobile device or the bar code scanner third party plugin is not installed. Since either condition will cause a JavaScript error, an alert dialog is displayed and the function exits gracefully.</description>

                <section>
                    <description>Next the cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner.scan function is called. Below is a snippet from the Bar Code Scanner plugins documentation page on  GitHub. As is very typical with PhoneGap, the call to the scan function is asynchronous and requires two callback functions, one for success and one for fail.</description>

                <section>
                    <description>As in the example code, the success and fail functions are anonymously defined within the scanBarCode function. This technique is very common for asynchronous JavaScript functions  and is used throughout the PhoneGap example code. You can choose to define independent external functions and simply call those functions if you wish.</description>

                    <title>The Scan Success Function</title>
                    <description>Our anonymous success function includes a result parameter which will contain a result object if the bar code scanner is able to read a bar code. From the PhoneGap example code it is easy to see the result object contains:</description>

                    <title>A Note on JavaScript Style</title>
                    <description>In this component, I've used a style that I prefer for JavaScript. Here are the basic rules I've followed:</description>
                    <steps>
                        <step>
                            <description>All globals are assigned to the {dialog.object}.appVars object.
                            </description>
                        </step>
                        <step>
                            <description>All function parameters are defined in lowercase, no leading characters. </description>
                        </step>
                        <step>
                            <description>All variables that are local to a function are defined with a leading underscore example: _result.
                            </description>
                        </step>

                    </steps>

                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>There is no right or wrong technique, just guidelines. Google has a decent JavaScript Style Guidelines available at: </description>

                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>Notice the result object is stored to an instance variable (previously defined) called {dialog.object}.appVars.scannerResult. This is required because the iTunesCallback function requires access to this information after a call is made to the Apple Search API. If the ISBN is NOT found in the iTunes store, the callback will display an alert that will reference the scanned ISBN and the barcode type. This information is in the result object. </description>
                    <cases>
                        <case>
                            <description>In this example component, all of the globals are defined  as part of the {dialog.object}.appVars object. This is referred to as an instance variable since the variables are assigned to a child object (appVars) of the UX component instance {dialog.object}. They are in fact global variables to the object instance.
                            </description>
                        </case>
                        <case>
                            <description>This technique keeps the components global variables contained within the object designated by the template placeholder {dialog.object} and keeps the global namespace clean, an important consideration in JavaScript programming.
                            </description>
                        </case>
                        <case>
                            <note>You may wonder why the placeholder {dialog.object} is used instead of a placeholder named {ux.object}. {dialog.object} comes from a legacy naming convention, used in previous versions of Alpha Anywhere. The UX was was derived from the legacy dialog component.</note>
                        </case>


                    </cases>

                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>At the top of the function, if result.cancelled is true the user cancelled the scan and a PhoneGap native alert dialog is presented.</description>


                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>If a result is returned, the scanned text is submitted to Apple's Search API for a lookup in the iTunes store.</description>

                <section>
                    <description>There are a number of ways to do this but in this case the new {dialog.object}.ajaxCallbackCrossDomain method is used to make the request. </description>

                    <description>Since the result from iTunes may or may not contain user ratings, a test is made to see if the data returned contains a variable named data.results[0].userRatingCount. If the data.results[0].userRatingCount variable exists, a template that includes ratings is used, otherwise, a template that excludes ratings is used. </description>

                    <description>This is a technique that allows you to define all of the HTML within the JavaScript functions. It provides a central location for all of the HTML, rather than defining the HTML within each container, which makes it harder to manage and edit the HTML used within your app. All you need to define within the HTML freeform container control is the div with an id that you will later populate with what may be dynamic content as in the case of the HTML we derive from the templates used within the barcode scan function. </description>

                    <title>Launching the inAppBrowser</title>
                    <description>The PhoneGap inAppBrowser plugin allows an app to load an external web page within the app without having to exit the app and load a mobile browser. Think of it as a browser within your app. Typically an Action Sheet appears from the bottom of the screen that contains the browser.</description>

                    <description>The component contains one JavaScript Action that is called from the myConfirmCallback function. This callback is fired when the 'Yes' or 'No' button is selected from the native.notification.confirm function which is tied to the Native Confirm button.</description>

                    <description>Since this JavaScript Action is going to be called programmatically from a callback function, the message to display needs to be stored in an instance variable. This should be clear from the code below which is tied to the confirmationCallback. Notice how {dialog.object}.appVars.msg is set to either Yes or No, depending upon which button the user clicks in response to the PhoneGap navigator.notification.confirm dialog. Also notice the use of the {dialog.object}.runAction method to run the confirmationAlert JavaScript action.</description>

                    <description>The JavaScript callback function name is myConfirmCallback. That is the function we just looked at. It is passed a btnIndex  which indicates the button the user clicked. Since the myConfirmCallback  calls another JavaScript Action (confirmationAlert), the result of the button selected is stored in an instance variable allowing reference to it from the confirmationAlert JavaScript.</description>

The free PhoneGap Build account only accommodates one (1) private app. If you would like to keep more than one (1) project active on PhoneGap Build you will need to setup a paid account.</description>

                    <description>Ajax callbacks are essential to create, edit and update the data stored within a UX component. In this chapter, we modify the Demo Mobile App included with Alpha Anywhere to run as a PhoneGap App that  communicates with an Alpha Anywhere Server, storing and retrieving photos from a backend database.</description>

                <section>
                    <description>In order to communicate with an Alpha Server, you MUST publish the initial UX component to an Alpha Anywhere Server and you MUST provide a proper URL to locate the server from within the PhoneGap app installed on the mobile device.</description>

                    <description>In order for a PhoneGap App, installed on a mobile phone or tablet to communicate with an Alpha Anywhere server, there are a number of considerations:</description>
                    <steps>
                        <step>
                            <description>What is the IP address of the server?</description>
                        </step>
                        <step>
                            <description>What protocol and port are being used by the server?</description>
                        </step>
                        <step>
                            <description>What is the name of the directory within the A5Weboot (if any) on your Alpha Anywhere Server that the component is being published to?
                            </description>
                        </step>
                        <step>
                            <description>What is the name of the component that the PhoneGap app is based upon?
                            </description>
                        </step>
                        <step>
                            <description>.Did you publish the component that the PhoneGap app is based upon to the Alpha Anywhere server?
                            </description>
                        </step>

                    <title>Determining  IP address of the server</title>
                    <description>For PhoneGap apps, it's best to use the IP address of your server rather than relying on DNS name resolution simply because it is faster. Your mobile users will never see this IP address when running your app.</description>

                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>Your testing will initially be done using the Alpha Development Server that is included with Alpha Anywhere. This is a server that runs on your development PC that allows a limited number of sessions (up to 5). It is perfect for testing and debugging PhoneGap apps on your mobile devices.</description>

                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>To determine the IP address in use on your machine, open a command prompt at enter ipconfig &lt;enter&gt;. Your screen will look similar to the image below:</description>

                        <link>images/img92.png</link>
                    </figure>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>Here we can see the IPv4 Address assigned to this machine is 192.168.10.21. Your machine's IP address will vary. Make a note of this value. In my development setup, this IP Address was issued by a wireless router running a DHCP server. For initial testing on a mobile device, it is important that the mobile device be on this same network/sub-net as the development server. You want to make sure your phone or tablet is tied in to the same wireless router as your development server.</description>

                <section>
                    <description>Make a note of the Server Port, and the status of the Enable SSL checkbox. In this example, the port in use is 81 and SSL is not being used. When SSL is not in use, the protocol used is HTTP. When Enable SSL is checked, the protocol used is HTTPS. You may also want to make a note of the document root so you can verify the component file exists (after publishing) within the target folder, should you run into any problems when running your app on a mobile device.</description>

                    <title>Determining the server publishing directory</title>
                    <description>The UX component that serves as the basis for the PhoneGap application (as specified within the PhoneGap App Builder Genie) must be published to the Alpha Anywhere server in order for the PhoneGap application installed on the mobile device to make callbacks to the Alpha Anywhere Server. To determine the publishing location, from within the Web Projects Control Panel, open the Publish settings dialog. </description>

                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>In the example below, the component is being published to a directory named test. Make a note of this directory.</description>

                    <title>Verify the web project properties </title>
                    <description>Before publishing the component or generating the PhoneGap App, it is a good idea to take a look at your Web Project Properties to ensure that you are only loading the JavaScript Libraries that you actually need for your component. In our case, we don't need any additional libraries. The idea is to keep the client side payload as small as possible.  From the Web Projects Control Panel select Project Properties. The Run-time Properties should match the dialog shown below.</description>

                    <description>While we have successfully deployed the Demo Mobile App as a native PhoneGap app (as covered in Chapter 8), there are a number of shortcomings  and features that require further enhancements. Some of the issues that need to be addressed to make this a polished native PhoneGap app include: Source </description>

                    <title>1. Resolve missing image thumbnails</title>
                    <description>When you run the demo app on your mobile device, you will notice the thumbnail images are not being displayed. This occurs because the images were not embedded within the list control when the app was packaged up for PhoneGap Build. </description>

                </section>
                <section>

                    <description>The original component makes an Ajax Callback to update these images when initially loaded. We could do that from within the PhoneGap app however, that will slow down the app and it's possible that the network may not be available. It is best to try to provide the initial data and populate the UI from the list control. This makes loading the app quite fast and if the network is not available, at least the UI is complete.</description>

                </section>
                <section>

                    <description>To embed the thumbnail images in the list control, open the component and select the CUSTOMERLIST control. Click on List Properties and select the ImageThumbnail in the Fields tab. Check Embed images into HTML.</description>

                <section>

                    <description>Now the thumbnail images will be stored in the list control as Base64 images, when the app is packaged up with the PhoneGap App Builder. This increases the app code size, but the true impact is small because the app is loaded on the mobile device. It will load quite fast.</description>

                    <title>2.Add Wait Modal Dialog On Ajax Callbacks</title>
                    <description>It is normally best to let the user know when the app is making an Ajax Callback because they are asynchronous. The Ajax request is made and in our case, the app waits for a response. If the network or server is not available, a timeout occurs.</description>

                <section>

                    <description>To display a message, we will use the showWaitMessage method of the UX component. From the Client side events, choose the canAjaxCallback event. This event always fires before an Ajax callback. The placeholder {dialog.object} is used to reference the current UX component name. </description>

                    <description>I am going to use the 'page' option  to display the message centered on the existing page. The second parameter is an object. Rather than define the object every time this event fires (which is ineﬃcient), I will create the object once and attach it to the {dialog.object}. This is done using onInitializeComplete event. Then I can use the object at any time. The code is eﬃcient and I have not polluted the global name space.</description>

                    <description>Should the device be oﬄine, it's impossible to make an Ajax callback. The UX component is able to track the online state. The onAjaxCallbackNotAvailable event will fire if an Ajax callback is attempted and the device is oﬄine. In this case, we want to inform the user that the device is oﬄine. I'm using a PhoneGap third party plugin called Toast to display a message that appears for a moment and then fades out. This requires no interaction from the user. If the plugin is missing, a JavaScript alert is used.</description>

                    <title>3.Transition to detail panel after Ajax callback is completed and all data loaded</title>
                    <description>When a row is tapped in the CUSTOMERLIST control, a callback is made to populate the data bound controls  contained within the PANEL_CUSTOMERFORM which represents a detail view. Because the callback is asynchronous, it is best practice to wait for the callback to complete prior to transitioning to the detail view panel card. This prevents the previous image from appearing when the detail view panel card is transitioned into view. </description>

                </section>
                <section>

                    <description>Rather than initiate the transition to the PANEL_CUTOMERFORM on the click event of the CUSTOMERLIST list control (that code is commented out in the image below), I'm setting a JavaScript variable attached to the {dialog.object} placeholder (which is the UX component) called _showCustomerDetailFlag to true.</description>

                </section>
                <section>

                    <description>Next, we are going to now use the client side afterPopulateFromTable event (which fires after a callback to populate the data bound controls of a UX component)  to transition the PANEL_CUSTOMERFORM into view, only if the {dialog.object)._showCustomerDetailFlag is true. This ﬂag is required because this event will fire after any callback that may populate populate data bound controls, such as the CUSTOMERLIST. </description>

                    <title>4. Displaying a modal alert when a change is detected in the online state</title>
                    <description>When a mobile app is dependent upon remote server access, it is a  good idea to let the user know when the online/oﬄine state of the device changes. </description>
                    <figure>
                        <link>images/img109.png</link>

                <section>

                    <description>The client side onConnectionChange event fires every time the network connection state changes. </description>

                </section>
                <section>

                    <description>In the example code above, I am setting a variable called _state with the string value of "online" or "oﬄine" based on the boolean value of the e.online parameter that is passed when the event fires. If the PhoneGap third party plugin Toast is available, it is used to display a modal message box that indicates the online state. The message box will fade out after a short period of time and requires no user intervention.. If the Toast plugin is not available, a JavaScript alert is used.</description>

                    <title>5.Verify the device is online and the Alpha Server is available prior to making an Ajax callback</title>
                    <description>In an effort to make the app as fast and responsive as possible, we can verify that the device is online and that the Alpha Server is available before initiating any Ajax callbacks. I consider this best practice. It's a bit tricky to do because a timer is required to check the availability of the server on a periodic basis.  It is also important that the server overhead to process this server heartbeat check is absolutely minimal, otherwise the server could become sluggish, wasting time and resources processing simple heartbeat requests for possibly thousands of clients.</description>

                <section>

                    <description>To monitor the state of the server, a global ﬂag is required. I am using a {dialog.object}.serverOnlineFlag in the code below. This is set to an initial state of true, assuming the server is available.</description>

                </section>
                <section>

                    <description>Next I am creating a JavaScript interval timer that will fire every 15 seconds. You can adjust this value as required but I do not recommend anything less than 15 seconds. The timer initially calls the {dialog.object}.getOnlineStatus method to determine if the device is online. If the device is online, then the {dialog.object}.serverIsAvailable method is called. This method takes a timeout value (I am using 750ms) and a success and fail function, which I am defining as anonymous functions. The success and fail functions toggle the state of {dialog.object}.serverOnLineFlag. If the device is not online, the serverOnlineFlag defaults to false.</description>

                <section>

                    <description>The serverIsAvailable method makes a very simple request to determine if the Alpha Server is available. Every effort has been made to make sure this request has minimal impact on the server. </description>

                    <description>Next we need to modify the canAjaxCallback client side event. </description>

                </section>
                <section>

                    <description>This event fires prior to the initiation of any Ajax callback made by the UX component. Since we are now setting the {dialog.object}.serverOnlineFlag in the interval {dialog.object}._a5ServerCheckTimer previously defined in the onInitializeComplete event, we can monitor its state to allow an Ajax callback to occur. If the ﬂag is set to false, a message is displayed indicating that the server is oﬄine and the callback is not initiated.</description>

                </section>
                <section>

                    <description>If the server is online the callback will fire and a wait message is displayed.</description>

                    <title>6.Updating the Customer List  when the app is loaded if the device is online and the Alpha Server is available.</title>
                    <description>When the app initially loads on the device, the Customer List data that is displayed is the data that was embedded within the component when the PhoneGap app was created within the PhoneGap App Builder. </description>

                </section>
                <section>

                    <description>It is a good idea to refresh this data as long as the device is online and the server is available. To do so we will add some more code to the onInitializeComplete event. Remember, this event only fires once, after the UX component initialization is complete.</description>
                    <figure>
                        <link>images/img112.png</link>
                    </figure>
                </section>
                <section>

                    <description>Here we are initially checking the device online status with the {dialog.object}.getOnlineStatus method. If the device is online, the {dialog.object}.serverIsAvailable method is called, with a timeout value of 1.5 seconds.  I set the timeout to be a bit longer here than in the previously installed interval timer because it's important to try to initially update the Customer list data and this timeout is masked by the app time associated with the app startup.</description>

                </section>
                <section>

                    <description>The onclick event of the MENULIST control calls a function called callMenuItem and passes in the selected item as an argument. We'll need to modify this function to refresh the CUSTOMERLIST when refresh is selected. </description>

                <section>

                    <description>The code should look familiar. If the {dialog.object}.serverOnlineFlag is set then the CUSTOMERLIST is refreshed by the {dialog.object}.refreshListData method. If the server is oﬄine, a message is displayed by either the Toast PhoneGap plugin (fades in then fades out with no user intervention) or by a JavaScript alert if the Toast plugin has not been installed.</description>

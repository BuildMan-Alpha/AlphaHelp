    <description>Used to guarantee ORDER BY clause criteria is unique in Grid Components based on a SQL database.</description>

        <p>Should the primary key be automatically added to all generated ORDER BY clauses? This is necessary to ensure that even when the user sorts on a field that would not normally generate unique sort keys (e.g. user sorts on the 'City' column), that the sort keys are unique. If you do not add the primary key to the ORDER BY clause and if the user sorts on a non-unique field, then when the user navigates from page to page in the Grid, it is possible for records that have appeared on a prior page to re-appear on a subsequent page.</p>
        <p>Only applies to Grids based on SQL databases. Does not apply if the SQL uses the 'DISTINCT' clause</p>

   <description>The 'Alphabet Buttons/Custom Buttons' Search feature creates an alphabet that users can utilize in searching for records alphabetically within a given field. For example, if you specify that your Alphabet buttons should search on the lastname field, when you click on the 'B' button, all records with lastnames that start with 'B' are shown. This section contains all of the properties that can be used to shape this search feature.

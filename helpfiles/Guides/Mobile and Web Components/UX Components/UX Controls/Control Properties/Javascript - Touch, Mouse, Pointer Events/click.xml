    <description>Specify the Javascript for this event. The click event fires when the 
        user presses and releases an element, with either the mouse, a finger, or a pointer. 
        Note that if, by the time the release takes place, the mouse, finger, or pointer has moved 
        off the original target position, then the event is not fired. Some elements do not 
        have this event.

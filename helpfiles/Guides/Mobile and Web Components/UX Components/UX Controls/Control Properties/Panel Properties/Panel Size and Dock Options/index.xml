    <description>A docked panel is a 'hidden' panel that can be revealed when a given event fires. 
        Whether or not a panel is dockable is defined here in the 'Panel Size and Dock Options' properties section 
        of a given Panel or Panel Navigator. The assignment of buttons to dock and or undock panels can be done in the Panel Layout 
        using the 'Docked Panel controller buttons' property in the Panel Layout Properties section of the Properties list.

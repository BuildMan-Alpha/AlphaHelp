    <description>Specify the Javascript to be executed when the value of the bound 
        variable is changed. The value of the bound variable is changed when the 
        user clicks a button, a setValue() method is called, or the bound variable is 
        changed in some other way. Differs from the onClick event which only fires when the user physically 
        clicks on a button.

    <topic>Pre-load data</topic>
    <description>This property appears when the SQL Data Source Type is choosen. It specifies if the data for this List should be pre-loaded when the data for this List's parent List is loaded.
        This option is typically used when you are loading data so that the UX can be used while disconnected.
        If the child List data are pre-fetched, then no Ajax callback is necessary to populate a child List when the 
        selected row in the parent List is changed.

      <description>In disconnected applications, when you define parent-child relationships between List controls you must set the child List's 'Pre-load data' property to true.
Even when building connected applications you might still want to define a parent-child relationship between Lists and define a Detail View for each List. This could
allow editing of the List data without the hassel of pre-loading the child data (since Alpha Anywhere can easily fetch the child data as needed as you have a connection).

  <description>You can edit data in the child List(s) (using the child List's Detail View) without checking the pre-load option, but you must specify linking values in the optional Linking fields section. The data you fill into these properties is used to ensure that the values in the linking fields are automatically set to the corresponding values in the parent List record when insert or updates are performed.</description>

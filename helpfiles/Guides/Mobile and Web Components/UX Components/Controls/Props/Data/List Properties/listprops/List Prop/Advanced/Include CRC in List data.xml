    <description>Specify if a CRC should be included for data in each row.</description>
    <discussion>For certain data source types, enabling *[ui:Include CRC in List data]* allows you to perform incremental refreshes of the data in the List. This allows you to update only the List data that has changed rather than needing to refresh all of the data when the *[js:{dialog.object}.refreshListData()]* method is called.</discussion>

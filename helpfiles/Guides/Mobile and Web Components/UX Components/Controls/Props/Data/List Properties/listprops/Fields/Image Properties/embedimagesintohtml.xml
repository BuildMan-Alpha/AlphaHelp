    <topic>Embed images into HTML</topic>
    <description>Specify if the image should be base64 encoded and embedded directly into the HTML.</description>

        <p>Embedding the image as base64 encoded data reduces the number of requests to the server to download the image data but results in a substantially larger initial payload sent from the server to the browser. This option is generally appropriate for 'small' images. Do not check this option if the image is specified by a URL.</p>
        <p>If this List is a child List and it is set to pre-fetch data, or if this List is a parent of a child List that is set to pre-fetch data, and this field is a binary field, then the images will automatically be embedded into the HTML as base64 encoded data. Under these circumstances, this property is checked automatically and is disabled so that it cannot be changed.</p>

    <topic>Sort column</topic>
    <description>Specify which column the data is sorted on when the user clicks. If the template for 
        this column only includes a placeholder for a single field, this sort column is typically set to the field 
        in the template. However, the template can reference multiple fields. If this is the case, then you need to be explicit 
        about which field is actually the sort field.

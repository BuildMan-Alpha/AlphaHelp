    <description>The Calendar Component allows you to display appointments that are stored in a SQL or DBF table in a calendar. New appointments can be added by clicking on the calendar. Existing appointments can be edited or moved.</description>

        <p>The Calendar Component relies on a 3rd party JavaScript Library supplied by Web2Cal. The component builder writes all of the integration logic to incorporate a Calendar into any web application.</p>
        <p>Using the Web2Cal library requires a license, which is purchased separately from Web2Cal. A license is not required to build and test a Calendar component using the Development Server. Unlicensed components cannot be deployed but can be tested on localhost using Live Preview or published locally.</p>

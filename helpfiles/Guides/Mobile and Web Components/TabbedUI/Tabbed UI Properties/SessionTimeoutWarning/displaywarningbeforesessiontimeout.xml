    <description>If enabled, a warning message will be shown when the user's session times out.</description>

        <p>In some application, the user's session can expire even though they may be actively using the application. This is typically seen in web applications where most of the scripting is done on the client. A session's lifetime is reset whenever an Ajax Callback is made to the Application Server. If most of the work in the application is processed on the client, however, it is possible for a user's session to expire even though they are using the app. This is problematic in situations where the user must be logged in to use an application. If the user's session expires, they are logged out of the security system and must login again before they can continue using an app.</p>
        <p>A warning message can be automatically displayed to alert the user when their session is about to expire. The warning includes a button the user can click to extend their session. In addition to displaying a message, you can also specify what happens when the user's session times out, including redirecting the user to another page.</p>
        <p>To add a warning message to the Tabbed UI Component to alert the user that their session is set to expire, check the *[ui:Display warning before session timeout]* property.</p>

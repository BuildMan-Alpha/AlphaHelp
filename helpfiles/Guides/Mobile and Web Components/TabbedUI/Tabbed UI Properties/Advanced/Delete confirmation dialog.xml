    <description>Displays a confirmation dialog before a control is deleted from the Tabbed UI layout.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>When you delete controls from the Tabbed UI Controls pane, Alpha Anywhere prompts for confirmation as deleting controls is a permanent action (there is no undo). *[ui:Delete confirmation dialog]* controls whether or not the confirmation is shown.</p>

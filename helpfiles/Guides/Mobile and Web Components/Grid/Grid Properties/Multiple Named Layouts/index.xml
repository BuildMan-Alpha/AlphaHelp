   <description>Alpha Anywhere allows you to define multiple named grid layouts. A named grid layout defines a way of arranging and displaying the data in a grid.
	   When you run a default layout it might show a grid with 10 columns. However when the Grid is displayed on a mobile device you might want a single layout column showing multiple fields.
	   Defining separate named layouts is the way you can go about adding this functionality to your app.

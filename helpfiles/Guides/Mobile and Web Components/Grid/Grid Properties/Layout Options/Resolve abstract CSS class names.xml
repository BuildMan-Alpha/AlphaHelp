			<description>When is it appropriate to use the class map when should you use the style editor to change the style in a class. Adjusting the class map really is for minor tweaks to the style. If you wanted to go make all of the edits input controls have a certain style it would be appropriate to do that in the style builder. But in some cases you might not get the fine control you need by adjusting the style and so making edits to the classmap will give you finer control over the appearance of individual elements in your web component.</description>

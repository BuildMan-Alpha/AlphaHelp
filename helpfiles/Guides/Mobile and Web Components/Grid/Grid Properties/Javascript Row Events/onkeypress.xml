        <p>The *[ui:onKeyPress]* event fires when the user presses a key on the keyboard that produces a character value, such as a letter, number, or punctuation. Keys that do not produce a character, such as shift and alt, will not trigger the *[ui:onKeyPress]* event.</p>
        <p>The event fires after the onKeyDown event. You can add Action Javascript, custom JavaScript, or sever-side Xbasic to execute one or more actions to this event.</p>
        <p>For more information about keyboard events, see [Mozilla's documentation on KeyboardEvents] or the developer documentation for your favorite web browser.</p>

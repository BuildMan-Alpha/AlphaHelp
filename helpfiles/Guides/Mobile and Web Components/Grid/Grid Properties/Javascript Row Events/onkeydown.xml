        <p>The *[ui:onKeyDown]* event fires when the user presses down a key on the keyboard when an element has focus. It is the first keyboard event to fire when the user presses a key. This event can be used to execute an Action Javascript, custom JavaScript, or server-side Xbasic to perform an action. For example, when filling out a text control, you may want to run some JavaScript when the user hits the Enter key.</p>

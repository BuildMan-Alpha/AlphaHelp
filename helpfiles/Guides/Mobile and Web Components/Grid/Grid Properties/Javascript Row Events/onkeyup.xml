        <p>The *[ui:onKeyUp]* event fires when the user releases a key that has been pressed. It is the last event to fire after the onKeyDown and onKeyPress events.</p>
        <p>You can add Action Javascript, custom JavaScript, or sever-side Xbasic to execute one or more actions to this event.</p>
        <p>For more information about keyboard events, see [Mozilla's documentation on KeyboardEvents] or the developer documentation for your favorite web browser.</p>

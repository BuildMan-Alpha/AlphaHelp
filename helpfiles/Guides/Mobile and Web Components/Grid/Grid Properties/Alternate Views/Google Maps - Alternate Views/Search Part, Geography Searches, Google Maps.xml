<description>Certain SQL databases (such as SQL Server, Oracle, DB2, MySQL, Postgres) support a special data type called 'Location'. </description>

<description>If a table has a location field (which contains information about a record's position - latitude and longitude), then you can perform 'geography' searches. For example, you can find all records that are within x miles of a certain location, or all records that fall within an area marked by the latitude and longitude of 3 or more points.  

You can put a Google Map in the Search part of the Grid to make specifying geography searches easy.  
This video shows how you can put a Google Map into the Search Part and how Alpha Anywhere automatically generates the Portable SQL to query the database. The video demonstrates both 'location' and 'radius' searches.

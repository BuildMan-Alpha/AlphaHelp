<description>It shows how you can display the Alternate Views in accordions, tabs or on the main page.  
The video shows how you can even suppress the display of the main Grid part and only show the Alternate view.  
In the video, we show the map, with a marker for each row in the Grid. The Grid itself is hidden. However, when the user clicks on a marker, the Detail View for the current row in the (hidden) Grid is shown.

		<description>Mapping features. Working preview. Grid part and Alternate View on the same page, all visible. Add a Search Part. Add a state field. Can see what elevation airports are on in different states. If you want, when you design your alternate views you could even turn off the grid part itself so that you only have the map and the detail view that you get to by clicking on the info box.

If you don't want the Main view to be shown simply pull it out of the freeform template.
Set accordion view in Main

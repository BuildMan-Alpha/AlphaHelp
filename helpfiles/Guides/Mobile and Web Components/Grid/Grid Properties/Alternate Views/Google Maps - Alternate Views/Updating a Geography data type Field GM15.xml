		<description>In order to perform a Geography search on a table, the table must have a special 'Geography' field (supported in certain SQL databases, such as SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, Postgress, DB2, etc.). The Geography field is a special type of field that contains binary data, so you can't update its value as easily in your SQL INSERT or UPDATE statement as you can for regular fields. However, it is highly desirable to automatically update the value in the Geography fields in a record whenever a longitude or latitude value is changed. 

This video shows how this is easily accomplished in a Grid component. Alpha Anywhere automatically generates the appropriate Portable SQL statement to update the Geography field whenever there are changes to the longitude or latitude field on which the Geography field is based.

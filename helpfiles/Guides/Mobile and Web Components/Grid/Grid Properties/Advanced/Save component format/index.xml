    <description>Specify if the Grid component should be saved as a binary file or as formatted JSON.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>Grid Components can be saved as formatted JSON or binary data. Formatted JSON saves the properties in clear text. This is useful if you are using some type of source or version control system and the system has a method to show differences between versions.</p>
        <p>The compiled file used to publish the Grid is always saved as binary. This is because a binary file has a smaller size than a JSON file.</p>

    <description>Check to include row separators between each summary value row.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The *[ui:Row separators between values]* property can be used to add a row separator between each summary value row. For example, if you have selected to show the 'Total' and 'Count' summary values, the Grid will have two summary rows: 'Total' and 'Count'. Checking this property will add a row separator between the 'Total' and 'Count' rows.</p>

    <description>Used when importing older projects built with Alpha Five Version 9 or earlier. Ajax is required for most features in Alpha Anywhere.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>Unless you are importing an Alpha Anywhere application built with Alpha Five Version 9 or older, the *[ui:Ajax enabled]* property should *[always]* be checked in the Grid Component.</p>
        <p>*[ui:Ajax enabled]* allows you to specify if this Grid component should use AJAX. With AJAX on you will get better performance and more features. If you turn AJAX off then all new features added in V10 and above will not work. In most cases, you should turn AJAX on. The option to turn AJAX off is provided for backward compatibility with V9 and previous version and should only be necessary in unusual cases where you are overriding certain settings at run-time.</p>

    <important>Ajax only available for DBF and AlphaDAO. ADO is not supported.</important>
    <warning>Do not disable this property for applications built with Alpha Anywhere.</warning>

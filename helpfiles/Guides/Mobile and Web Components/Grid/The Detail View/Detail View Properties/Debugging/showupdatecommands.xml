    <description>Show the SQL or Xbasic statements that are generated to perform INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE commands.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The *[ui:Show update commands]* is used to display the generated INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE SQL commands used by Alpha Anywhere to commit changes to a database when a record is edited using a Detail View in a Grid component. Enabling the display of update commands is useful for any developer who wants to learn more about working with SQL using Xbasic or is planning to override update statements using one of the Grid's server-side events.</p>
        <p>The update commands will be shown in an HTML table below the Grid part. In addition to displaying the SQL statement that used to update the data, the values of any arguments and the Grid row number for the record that was updated are also shown.</p>

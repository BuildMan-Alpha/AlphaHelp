    <description>Show the SQL or Xbasic statements that are generated to perform INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE commands.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The *[ui:Show update commands]* is used to display the generated INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE SQL commands for committing changes to a database when a record is edited using a Detail View in a Grid component. Enabling *[ui:Show update commands]* is useful for any developer who wants to learn more about working with SQL using Xbasic. *[ui:Show update commands]* is also useful for implementing and debugging custom SQL command overrides defined in the Grid component's server-side events.</p>
        <p>When enabled, the update commands are shown in an HTML table below the Grid part. The table includes the Grid row number of the affected record, the generated SQL statement, and the values for any arguments used in the SQL statement.</p>

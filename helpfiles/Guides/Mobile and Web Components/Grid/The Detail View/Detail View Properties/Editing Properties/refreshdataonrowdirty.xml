   <description>When a user begins editing in a row, should a callback be executed to get current data?</description>
   <discussion>
       <p>The *[ui:Refresh data on row dirty]* setting can be used to specify that the data for the Grid row should be refreshed from the server when it becomes dirty. The refresh is performed by making an Ajax Callback to the server when the user starts to edit a value in the row.</p>
       <p>This option is only available if the *[ui:Row edit style]* has been set to 'AllRows'.</p>

    <topic>Row refresh method after edits</topic>
   <description>After data is updated, deleted or inserted, specify how the data in the Grid should be refreshed. 'AutoSelect' - let Alpha Anywhere choose a method, 'FullPage' - refresh all records in the Grid (slowest, but guarantees that all summary fields and linked records are refreshed),  'SingleRow' - only refreshes data in the edited row, 'Minimal' - fastest method, but will not update summary fields.</description>

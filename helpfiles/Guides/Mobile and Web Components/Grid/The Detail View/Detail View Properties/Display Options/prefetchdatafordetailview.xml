    <topic>Pre-fetch data for Detail View</topic>
   <description>If you choose this option, it will take a little longer for the page to display initially, but then once the page has displayed, clicking on a Detail View link will display the Detail View immediately (without a server round trip). Your browser will use JavaScript to populate the Detail View from the pre-fetched data.</description>
   <important>If your Detail View has any 'Custom' controls you should not use the pre-fetch option.</important>

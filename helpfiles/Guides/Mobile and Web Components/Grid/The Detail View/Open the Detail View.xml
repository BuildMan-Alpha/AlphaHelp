	<description>Once you open the Grid Builder , go to the Design page and click on Component Type at the top of the Design page menu. Under the Grid Layout Menu select Grid is: Read Only . Then go down to the b ottom of the page and check the Grid contains a Detail View checkbox. If you checked 'Grid is: Updateable', then the 'Grid contains a Detail View box' will remain inactive. Making the grid 'Updateable' gives users the ability to update information directly within the fields of a grid, making the Detail View somewhat redundant. You might notice that the Detail View also has a ' Read Only ' and ' Updateable ' option.

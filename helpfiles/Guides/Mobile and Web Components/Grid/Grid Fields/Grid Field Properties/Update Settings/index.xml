			<title>Check for write conflicts</title>
			<description>
				<p>When updating records, if 'Check for write conflicts' is turned on, should this field be included in the section of fields that are checked for write conflicts?</p>
				<p>If the data type for a field precludes it from being used in a WHERE clause with an = operator, the field is automatically excluded from write conflict checking.</p>
			</description>
			<note>
				<p>In some older versions of Alpha Anywhere, check for write conflicts must be manually disabled if the type for the field cannot be used in a WHERE clause (which is what is required in order to use a field in a write conflict check.) For example, the 'ntext' type in SQL Server.</p>

If this field is blank, the field will not be automatically updated when a record is inserted or updated. To automatically update this field, enter the longitude and latitude field title (comma delimited). For example:</p>

                <title>Grid with an Embedded Grid in a Cell</title>
                <description>Grids are completely recursive. That means that Grids can be placed inside other Grids up to any depth that you want. In this example, we have a simple Grid showing customers. One of the columns in the Grid contains an embedded Grid showing the Invoices for that customer. This embedded Grid, in turn, has a row expander. When you open the row expander, it shows all of the invoice items for the selected invoice. Normally, each cell in a tabular Grid contains a single field. But in this example, instead of placing a single field in a column cell, we have placed an entire Grid.</description>

    <description>Event handlers to add custom behaviors to the Grid. Behaviors can be added using Action Javascript, JavaScript, or server-side Xbasic.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The *[ui:Javascript]* properties is a list of event handlers that can be used to extend your application with custom behaviors. For example, the onClick event for a button could be used to display a report or the onChange event for a dropdown box could be used to update the choices in another dropdown.</p>
        <p>Event handler properties correspond to the matching HTML inline event handler for the control. All event handlers are passed an event object in a variable called *[js:event]*. The *[js:event]* object is the object passed to the event handler by the browser. For keyboard events, *[js:event]* will contain information about what keys have been pressed. See *[extlink:Event (MDN Web Docs)@https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event]* for more information about the event object.</p>
        <p>While all event handlers may be listed, some controls do not fire the event handler. For example, a Button does not fire the onChange event.</p>
        <p>Javascript event handlers do not support touch devices. If you need to implement an app with touch support, use the UX Component.</p>

    <topic>Embed image in HTML</topic>
   <description>Specify if the image should be base64 encoded and embedded directly into the HTML. This reduces the number of server round-trips to get the image data, but results in a substantially larger initial payload being sent from the server to the browser. This option is generally only appropriate for 'small' images. Do not check this option if the image is specified by a URL.</description>

	<description>The Preview Pane appears in the Component Type page and shows a small sample of the grid's appearance using the currently selected style sheet. Clicking the Click here to zoom preview window text at the bottom of the preview pane puts the preview inside of its own Component Layout dialog. If you change the properties of your grid and click the Refresh Preview button, these changes will be reflected in the Preview Pane (as shown below). Alpha Anywhere also contains Live Preview and Working Preview windows that let you see your component on the server and debug it.</description>

			<obsolete>The Grid Builder Preview Tab was removed in Alpha Anywhere Build 1605-4168. It provided a quick WYSIWYG look at your work, but was not interactive. To preview a Grid Component, use [Live Preview] or [Working Preview].</obsolete>

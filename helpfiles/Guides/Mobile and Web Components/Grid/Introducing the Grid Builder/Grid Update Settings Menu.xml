<description>The Grid > Update Settingsmenu only appears if the grid is updateable. This is where you control user delete, update, and insert operations. There are quite a number of security permissions that can be set in the update menu. These will allow certain users to edit, add, and delete records while restricting the ability of other users to do so. See the Setting Update Properties page as well as the Controlling Record Updatepage for more information about Update Settings.

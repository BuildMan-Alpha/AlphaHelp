   <description>When you create or edit a web component you might want to give some users the ability to delete, modify, and or insert records. </description>
<sections>
	<section>
		<description>At the same time, you might want to deny this ability to other users. In order to achieve this in Alpha Anywhere you will first have to define what groups you wish to create by setting up your web security. Once you have some groups and users defined   setting what permission each group has over a component is relatively easy.  </description>
</section>
<section>
	<description>Below you can see how adding permissions to a grid alters their final look. This is the same grid that was created in the 'Creating a Grid for Microsoft Access Using the SQL Builder' Guide. The user on the left can enter information into open fields, delete it, save entered information, undo changes using the undo button, and ultimately Submit everything. The grid on the right has had security added to it such that only one group has access to it. Users without access can see records in this grid but they can not alter those records or add new ones.

			<description>Under the Update Settings Permissions options you can adjust a groups ability to delete, update, or insert records into a component. The permission property for a grid is compared to a protected session variable named session.protectedSecurityLevel. Your application code should set this variable to reflect the permissions of the current user</description>

    <topic>Permanently hide buttons pane</topic>
   <description>Specify if the buttons pane should be permanently eliminated from the Tabbed UI. If you choose this option, then you must set then 'Auto launch on startup' property for the objects that you want to see in the Tabbed UI. You should also uncheck the 'Can close pane' property for each object, or else, if the user closes a pane, there will be no way to re-open the pane.</description>

			<title>Licensing your calendar</title>
			<description>Before you can publish your calendar to a site for general use you will need to buy a license to allow it to run on that site, and enter the license number into the calendar properties. If you do not purchase a calendar license, your calendar will only run on localhost and 127.0.0.1.</description>

			<title>Using Calendar Arguments</title>
			<description>When launching the Calendar from a Grid or another component, you will want to set one or more of the Calendar's arguments, to control what is displayed dynamically.</description>

				<title>Dynamically Creating New Records in the Calendars Table</title>
				<description>
					<p>When the Calendar Component is opened, it can be configured to only display the events for a particular calendar.</p>
					<p>For example, you might have an 'Employees' table and you might have a Grid which shows the records in the Employees table.</p>
					<p>A button in each row of the Grid opens the Calendar Component showing the appointments for that particular Employee. However, if there is no matching record in the Calendar table for the Employee, it would be convenient to automatically create a new record in the Calendars table before opening the Calendar.</p>
					<p>This video shows how this is easily done.</p>

				<title>Opening the Calendar Component and Showing a Selected  List of Calendars</title>
				<description>
					<p>When the Calendar Component is opened from a button in a Grid or UX Component, you can specify which calendars (i.e. the calendar for  Dr. Jones, Dr. Smith, etc.) should be shown on the Calendar.</p>
					<p>This video shows how you can read the list of calendars to show from  a column in the Grid.</p>

				<title>Opening the Calendar Component and Showing a List of Related Calendars</title>
				<description>
					<p>Assume that you have a Grid that contains a list of people for which calendars have been defined. When you click a button to open the Calendar Component for a particular person, you would like to see the calendars for 'related' people as well. In addition, you would like the 'related' calendars to be read-only, while the main calendar is updatable.</p>
					<p>This video shows how you can define a 'link table' that indicates what the 'related' calendars are for each calendar. For example, whenever the calendar for Dr. Smith (id = 3) is shown, you also want to see the calendars for Dr. Jones (id = 27) and Dr. King (id = 33).</p>
					<p>This video shows how this can be done by putting a Linked Content Section in the main Grid. The Linked Content Section shows the Grid based on the 'link table'.</p>

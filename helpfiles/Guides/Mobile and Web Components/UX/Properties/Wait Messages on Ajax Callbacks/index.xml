    <description>Settings for adding a wait message to the UX Component that is shown when a callback to the server is made.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p> In mobile applications, where network connections are often slow, it becomes important to let the user know that there will be a delay while an Ajax callback completes. This is easily done with a global setting in the UX Component.</p>
        <p>To turn on automatic wait messages, go to the Properties pane in the UX Component and check the *[ui:Show wait messages on Ajax callbacks]* property.</p>

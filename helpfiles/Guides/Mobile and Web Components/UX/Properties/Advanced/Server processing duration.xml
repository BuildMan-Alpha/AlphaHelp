        <p>Defaults to 300 (seconds). The *[ui:Server processing duration]* defines how long in seconds the server should wait for an Ajax Callback to complete after the server has lost connection to the client-side application before halting callback execution. This setting is used with the *[ui:Processing option for lost connection]* property. If *[ui:Processing option for lost connection]* is set to "Stop", the Ajax Callback is halted immediately. If *[ui:Processing option for lost connection]* is set to "Continue", the Ajax Callback will continue processing until the the *[ui:Server processing duration]* is reached.</p>

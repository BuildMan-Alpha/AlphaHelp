        <p>Defaults to 300 (seconds). The *[ui:Server processing duration]* defines how long in seconds the server should wait for an Ajax Callback to complete before halting callback execution. If *[ui:Processing option for lost connection]* is set to "Stop", the Ajax Callback will terminate when either the connection is lost or the processing duration is reached. If *[ui:Processing option for lost connection]* is set to "Continue", the Ajax Callback will continue processing until the the *[ui:Server processing duration]* is reached.</p>

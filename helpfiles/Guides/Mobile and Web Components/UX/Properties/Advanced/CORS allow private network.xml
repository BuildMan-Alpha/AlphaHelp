    <description>Enables cross origin requests from private networks to the UX component.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>*[ui:CORS allow private network]*, when enabled, will send the required CORS header to allow a public origin make a cross site request to an Alpha Anywhere server hosted on a private network (e.g. behind a firewall). For instance, you have a page loaded from an S3 bucket https://example.s3.amazonaws.com/example/index.html which is public, and this component runs on an internal Alpha Anywhere server https://myserver.example.com/. Cross site requests to the Alpha Anywhere server will be denied unless the setting is checked. Defaults to unchecked.</p>
        <p>Checking this option adds *[bold:Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network:true]* to the header response sent to the origin that makes the request.</p>
        <p>This setting is only available if *[ui:Add CORS headers]* is checked.</p>

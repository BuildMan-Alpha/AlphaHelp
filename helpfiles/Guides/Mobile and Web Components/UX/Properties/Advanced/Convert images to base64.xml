    <description>If enabled, base64 encodes all images referenced in the UX and embeds them in the HTML for the application.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>When an app is loaded in the browser, a separate request is made to the server to download any images that are part of the application. If the app contains a large number of images, this can have a negative performance impact when the app is initially loaded.</p>
        <p>Performance of an application with a large number of images can be improved by embedding the images in the HTML sent from the server to the client. Embedding the images reduces the number of files to download from the server.</p>
        <p>The *[ui:Convert images to base64 encoded in-line images]* property, when enabled, automatically base64 encodes any images in the component and embeds them in the generated HTML before sending it to the client. This property is disabled by default.</p>

        <p>Allows a user to reset their password if they have forgotten their password. Modern web applications typically never allow password recovery. However, if a user has forgotten their password, they do allow password reset. If you check the *[ui:Allow password reset]* property, the Login UX will display the HYPERLINK_FORGOTPASSWORD link control to reset the user's password. The default label is "Forgot Password?". You can customize the label by changing the *[ui:Hyperlink text]* for the HYPERLINK_FORGOTPASSWORD UX control.</p>

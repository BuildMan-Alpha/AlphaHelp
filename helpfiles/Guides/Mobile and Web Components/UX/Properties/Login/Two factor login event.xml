    <description>An Xbasic function to call prior to display the 2nd factor dialog in an application with two-factor authentication.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>In some cases, even though a user has turned on two-factor authentication, you might want to suppress the 2nd factor dialog.</p>
        <p>You can specify the name of an Xbasic function (in both the TabbedUI and UX component) to call before the 2nd factor dialog is shown. If the code in your Xbasic function sets:</p>
        <p>
            <example code="xb"><![CDATA[e.suppress2ndfactorLogin = .t.]]></example>
        </p>
        <p>then the 2nd factor dialog will not be shown and the user will be logged in.</p>

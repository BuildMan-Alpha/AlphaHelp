    <description>The Panel to navigate to when the user logs in successfully.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>If the *[ui:After login behavior]* property is set to "FocusPanelCard", the *[ui:Target Panel]* property is shown. This property defines the Panel in the UX component to navigate to after the user logs in to the application. In the [Login UX], this property is set to *[PANELCARD_APPLICATION]*.</p>
        <p>The "FocusPanelCard" option is often used in mobile apps that need to work offline. The alternative, "RedirectToTargetPage", makes a call to the Application Server to load the specified target page. If your device is offline, the page cannot be loaded.</p>
        <p>To use the "FocusPanelCard" method, place your main application inside the specified *[ui:Target Panel]* on the UX. When the user logs in, the panel containing the app is shown. The main application can be included as an [embedded component] or by directly adding the controls for your app to the panel.</p>

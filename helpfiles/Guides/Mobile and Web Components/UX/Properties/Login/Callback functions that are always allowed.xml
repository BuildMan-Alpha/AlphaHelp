    <description>A comma-delimited list of callback functions defined in the UX Component that can be called without requiring the user to be logged in.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>If the Persistent login is enabled and the UX contains a button that makes an Ajax callback before the user has logged in, the callback is denied. You may want some Ajax callbacks to be allowed when the user is not logged in. *[ui:Callback functions that are always allowed]* can be used to specify a list of Xbasic callback functions that are allowed even though the user is not logged in.</p>
        <p>Allowed callbacks are specified as a comma-delimited list names of Xbasic functions defined in the *[ui:Xbasic functions]* section. For example, to allow calling Xbasic functions "myCallback1" and "myCallback2", you would enter:</p>
        <p>
            <example><![CDATA[myCallback1,myCallback2]]></example>
        </p>

    <topic>Submit dialog if has client-side validation errors</topic>
    <description>When the user clicks the submit button, if a client-side validation error has already been 
        detected, should the dialog be submitted anyway? If a client-side validation error has already 
        been found, you might want to prevent the dialog from being submitted to the server (since you already 
        know that there are some errors in the dialog). On the other hand, you might want to still submit 
        so that you can get a full list of all of the errors; by evaluating the server-side validation rules.

    <description>If any fields have validation errors, show a message on the dialog to indicate 
        that there were errors. Note that if the component uses Panels, and the message is not shown, 
        you should specify a Javascript function to call and write your own handler. Additionally, the 
        client-side 'onFieldValidationError' event will fire if there are any server-side field level 
        validation errors.

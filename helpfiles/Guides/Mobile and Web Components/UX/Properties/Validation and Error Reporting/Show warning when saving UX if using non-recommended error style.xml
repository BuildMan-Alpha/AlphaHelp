    <topic>Show warning when saving UX if using non-recommended error style</topic>
    <description>If the 'Layout style' is set to 'ContainerWidth' the error styles of 'icon' and 
        'inline' are not recommended because they will display the error icon/error text underneath 
        the control, not to the right of the control as you would have expected. It is recommended 
        that you NOT set the error style to 'icon' or 'inline' when using the 'ContainerWidth' mode. 
        If this checkbox is checked, then every time you save this UX component in the UX Builder, 
        you will get a warning telling you that you have selected an error style that is not recommended.

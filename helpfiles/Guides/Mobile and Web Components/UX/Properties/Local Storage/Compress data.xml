        <p>If List data is persisted to Local Storage, the *[ui:Compress data before storing in Local Storage]* property can be used to compress the data before it is stored in Local Storage. Compression makes it possible to store more data in Local Storage.</p>
        <p>Compression can be used with *[ui:Minify data]* to maximize the amount of data stored in Local Storage.</p>

                <title>Disconnected Applications - Compressing Data Before Storing it in Local Storage</title>
                <description>
                    <p>When you build applications that are designed to work while disconnected, the data in the List controls in your UX component are persisted to Local Storage. There is a limit to the amount of data that can be put into Local Storage. The limit varies by browser, but it typically in the 5MB range.</p>
                    <p>By compressing the data before it is put into Local Storage you can store more data. In this video we show how to turn the compression feature on and how to measure the impact of data compression.</p>

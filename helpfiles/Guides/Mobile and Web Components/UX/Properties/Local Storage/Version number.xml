        <p>The *[ui:Version number]* property is used to assign version information to the data stored in Local Storage. As applications evolve over time, the schema for data can change. For example, adding or removing fields in a Detail View. When the variables in the UX component change, the underlying JSON object persisted to Local Storage also changes. You can use version numbers to indicate when the variables in the UX component have changed. If the version number is increased, any existing data in Local Storage is not restored.</p>

        <p>When developing or debugging offline applications in Working Preview, you can choose to save persisted data to a file on the file system instead of in the browser's Local Storage. This makes it easier to inspect the data persisted to Local Storage while developing applications. The *[ui:Working Preview folder for Local Storage testing]* property is used to define where data is saved in Working Preview when persisted to Local Storage.</p>
        <p>This property only applies to Working Preview when the *[ui:Working Preview testing mode]* is set to 'Filesystem'. The video below explains this property.</p>

                    <p>When you build an application for disconnected operation you need to be sure that the data in the application is persisted to Local Storage so that edits that are made to any data are not lost if the application is restarted before the user has had a chance to synchronize the data with the server.</p>

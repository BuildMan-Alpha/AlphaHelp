            <description>When you check *[ui:Minify data]*, blank fields in the JSON data are removed and system fields that are used internally in the List (these are field that have a leading '*' in their name) are omitted from the persisted data. This can result in a significant reduction in the amount of space needed by the List data in Local Storage.</description>

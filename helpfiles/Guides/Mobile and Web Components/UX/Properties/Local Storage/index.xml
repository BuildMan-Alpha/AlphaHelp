    <description>Configure the namespace information, data compression, additional data to persist, and debugging behaviors in working preview for the data persisted to Local Storage (or the file system) for an application.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The UX component's *[ui:Local Storage/File System Storage]* properties define how data is stored in local storage when persisted in a List. This includes whether or not data saved in Local Storage should be restored to the Lists (and variables) when the component is accessed after the user has closed the app (or web page.) You can optionally specify that variables should be persisted to local storage for the component.</p>
        <p>Several debugging options are also available to control where data is stored when debugging using Working Preview.</p>

                    <p>When you build an application for disconnected operation you need to be sure that the data in the application is persisted to Local Storage so that edits that are made to any data are not lost if the application is restarted before the user has had a chance to synchronize the data with the server.</p>

        <p>When testing a component in Working Preview, you can simulate Local Storge by saving the data in a file on the computer. This allows you to easily see what is (or isn't) being stored in Local Storage while you are developing your app.</p>
        <p>Data can be persisted to two locations in Working Preview. The 'Browser' or the 'Filesystem'.</p>
        <p>If data is persisted to the Browser, it will be stored in Local Storage for the browser used for Working Preview (Working Preview can be run using either Internet Explorer or Chrome.)</p>
        <p>If data is persisted to the file system, you can pecify the location where data is stored. While you are developing your app, storing data in the file system allows you to look at what information is being stored.</p>

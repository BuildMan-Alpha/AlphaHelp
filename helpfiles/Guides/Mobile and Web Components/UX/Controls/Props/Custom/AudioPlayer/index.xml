    <discussion>
        <p>The [Audio Player] and [Audio Recorder/Player] controls can be used to add the ability to play and record audio files in a mobile application. The properties below are available for configuring these controls, including control messages, settings for configuring recording and playback quality, and events for adding custom JavaScript that is executed when the user performs an action, such as playing an audio file or pausing a recording.</p>

    <note>
        <p>The [Audio Player] control can be used in both web and mobile applications. The [Audio Recorder/Player] control is  only supported in Cordova apps or applications deployed using [Alpha Launch].</p>

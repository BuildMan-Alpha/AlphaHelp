            <description>
                <p>The *[ui:onBeforeOverwriteRecording]* event fires when there is an existing recording and the user clicks the record button. If there is an existing recording, the recording will get overwritten. This event will allow you to prompt the user if they really want to overwrite the existing recording. If the event returns false, the new recording is aborted.</p>
                <p>This event is available with the [AudioRecorderAndPlayer] control.</p>

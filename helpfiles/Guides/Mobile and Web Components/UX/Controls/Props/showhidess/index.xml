            <description>
                <p>An expression evaluated on the server that determines whether or not the control should be shown. The show/hide expression can refer to session variables or arguments defined in the Properties pane. The control is shown if the expression is true.</p>
                <p>If the expression is false or invalid, perhaps because a referenced session variable has not yet been defined, the control will be hidden. Alpha Anywhere achieves this by omitting the control's HTML from the data sent to the client. This means the control cannot later be shown without first making an Ajax Callback to the server to refresh the component.</p>

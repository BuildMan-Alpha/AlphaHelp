    <topic>Synchronize when Panel Card gets focus</topic>
    <description>When you have an embedded UX component this property allows you to automatically synchronize the UX every time the Panel Card gets focus (assuming that the Panel Card is contained in a Panel Navigator).
If this option is checked, the embedded UX component's server-side onSynchronize event and client-side onSynchronizeDialog events are fired.

          <description>You can embed grid and UX objects by going to the 'Other Controls' menu and double clicking on the [Embedded Object]
              option. This will allow you to select an object to embed from a list of components that you have created.

            <description>Below is a very simple Panel Layout container containing two Panel Cards, each containing a [Static Text] control. 
            The background styling of each Panel Card has also been altered to make them more visible.

            <description>The Panel Layout can itself contain additional Panel Layout containers that might have different Layout flow directions from their 
            parent. Panel Navigators contained in a Panel Layout should follow the same Layout flow direction that Panel Cards do, in terms of the Panel Navigators placement.
             The 'Layout flow direction' also determines the way in which a docked, or 'hidden', panels will appear on screen when revealed. 
             For example, if the 'Layout flow direction' is Left to Right, the docked panel will appear to enter from the left side of the screen moving toward to right side.

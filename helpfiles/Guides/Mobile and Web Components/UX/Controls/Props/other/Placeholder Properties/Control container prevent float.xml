    <topic>Control container prevent float</topic>
    <description>Advanced/Optional. All controls are automatically wrapped in a div, 
        with a class name of 'A5CWLayout' or 'A5container', unless the control is in a 'NoFloat' container. 
        This container automatically 'floats' the control, so that your controls lay out automatically from left to 
        right until a control with a 'break after' is encountered. In addition, the 
        class adds padding around the control. By checking this property, you are 
        specifying that the div container that encloses this control will not have the 'A5CWLayout' or 
        'A5container' class applied.</description>

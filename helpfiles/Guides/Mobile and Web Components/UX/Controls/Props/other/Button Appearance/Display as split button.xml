    <topic>Display as split button</topic>
    <description>Specify if the button should be split into two 'logical' buttons, with the button and the dropdown icon separated into two logical buttons. If you use this option you should define your event handler in the 'onClick' rather than the 'click' event. You will then be able to refer to arguments[1] in your code to see if the user clicked on the dropdown icon or the button, arguments[1] will be set to either 'normal' or 'split'.</description>

    <description>One or more UX controls to read data from to populate the FormView.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The *[ui:UX Controls]* property defines what controls to read from the UX component to populate the FormView control. The [...] smart filed button will display a list of available controls. Select the controls from the list that you'd like to use to populate the FormView.</p>
        <p>When using this method to populate the FormView, the UX Controls are often hidden in the UX layout so they're not displayed when the application is rendered.</p>

        <p>If the *[ui:Allow editing]* property is checked, the field's value can be edited by tapping or clicking the field to open an Editor for the field. The associated Editor is defied on the 'Fields' tab.</p>
        <p>If no Editor is defined for the field, the field cannot be edited as no interface has been defined to use to edit the field.</p>

    <note>If this box is not checked, the 'a5-item' attribute will not be included in the HTML that is generated for this control. If a control does not include the 'a5-item' attribute, the control will not be included in the list of control that are navigated through using .formViewNavigate() method.</note>

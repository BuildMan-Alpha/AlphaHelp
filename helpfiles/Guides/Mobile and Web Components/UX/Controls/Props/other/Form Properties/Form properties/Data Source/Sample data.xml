        <p>If the FormView's *[ui:Datasource type]* is *[Javascript]* or *[Custom]*, the *[ui:Sample data]* property is shown. *[ui:Sample data]* is a JSON string that defines the structure of the data source, including field names and nested arrays. Sample data is used to inform the FormView builder what fields are available for configuring Editors, Editor Sets, and FormView Layout.</p>

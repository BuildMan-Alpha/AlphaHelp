                    <p>Most fields in a FormView control are edited in an associated 'editor'. When the user taps on the field in the Form, the associated editor is opened, the user edits the form field value and then saves the edited value back to the form. This is called 'indirect editing'. </p>
                    <p>There are cases, however, where 'immediate' editing of a value would be more convenient than having to go to a separate editor to edit the value. A good use case for an 'immediate' editor is a toggle field that has two states, such as 'Yes' or 'No' for a 'Married' field. A 'switch' control is ideal for this use case. </p>
                    <p>In this video we show how you can add a switch control to a FormView. The switch control acts as an 'immediate' editor.</p>

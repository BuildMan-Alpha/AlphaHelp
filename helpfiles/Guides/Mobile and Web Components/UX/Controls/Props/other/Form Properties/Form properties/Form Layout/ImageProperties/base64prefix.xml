   <description>The prefix (if required) to add to the base64 encoded image data. This is required if the image is base64 encoded and does not include a prefix.</description>

       <p>If the base64 data in the field already has a prefix in the base64 encoded data (e.g. 'data:image/jpg;base64,' ) then you will not need to add a prefix. If the data in the field is raw base64 encoded data, you will need to add the appropriate prefix.</p>

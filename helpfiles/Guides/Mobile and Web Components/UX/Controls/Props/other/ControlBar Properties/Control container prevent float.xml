<topic>Control container prevent float</topic>
<description>Advanced and Optional. All controls are automatically wrapped in a div (with a class name of 
	'A5CWLayout' or 'A5container'), unless the control is in a 'NoFloat' container. This container automatically 
	'floats' the control. This results in the controls laying out automatically from left to right, until a control with 'break after' 
	is encountered. The class adds padding around the control. By checking the 'Control container prevent float' 
	property you are specifying that the div container that encloses this control will not have the 'A5CWLayout' 
	or 'A5container' class applied.

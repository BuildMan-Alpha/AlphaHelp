<description>The Button-Toggle Settings allow you to specify various aspects of the button-toggle item; such as 
	whether the button-toggle will switch between two buttons (Two State) or more than two buttons (Multi-state) when 
	a user clicks on it. These settings also allow for the definition of a 'Data variable'. This can be used as a hook 
	that enables the button-toggle to interact with other controls, like a list control.

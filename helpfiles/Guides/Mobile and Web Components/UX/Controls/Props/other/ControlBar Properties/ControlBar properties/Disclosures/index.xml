<topic>Disclosures</topic>

<description>Disclosures are similar to pop-up windows that are displayed when a disclosure-button is clicked. You can either specify some explicit HTML to be shown as the disclosure or you can specify that a ControlBar Layout should be shown.
The Disclosure pane in the ControlBar builder is used to define Disclosures that display explicitly defined HTML.
When you want to display standard UX controls (such as input controls, Lists, buttons, ViewBoxes, etc.) in a disclosure, you define a new disclosure on the Disclosure pane and then, when defining the HTML for the disclosure, you can add the contents of a InjectibleContent container to the disclosure. The following properties are used with ControlBar disclosures.</description>

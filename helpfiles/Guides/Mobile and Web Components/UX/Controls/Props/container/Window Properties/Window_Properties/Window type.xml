  <description>Specify the window type. Popup windows will be shown in a movable window on the page. 
    Dropdown windows have no title bar and cannot be moved. By default, Dropdown windows open directly 
    below the control that you click to open the window. Note, an Ajax window will NOT be blocked 
    by a browser's internal protection against popup windows.

        <p>Controls placed in an AbsoluteLayout container can be positioned manually to appear in a fixed location within the container. If the RadioButton control is populated with static data, the position of each radio button in the control can be positioned "absolutely". An AbsoluteLayout contaienr is often used in web applications to add controls over a background image, such as a tax document or hospital form.</p>

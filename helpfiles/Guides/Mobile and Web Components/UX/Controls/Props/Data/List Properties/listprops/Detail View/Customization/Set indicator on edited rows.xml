    <topic>Set indicator on edited rows</topic>
    <description>When a row in the List is edited, marked as deleted, or added, the row's appearance is changed 
        (by applying a CSS class, which you can customize) to indicate that the row has been edited. If you uncheck 
        this property, then edited rows will not be indicated.

        <description>By default a yellow marker represents an edited row, a purple marker represents a deleted row, and a blue marker represents an added row.
             The ability to add and delete rows can be included in a component by opening the Defined Controls menu, 
             on the UX Controls page, and clicking the 'List-Detail View-Buttons' option. Check the 'New record' and 'Delete record' 
             options to add these buttons.

            <title>What is an Orphaned Media File?</title>
            <description>Orphaned media files apply to disconnected applications. An example might be An SQL table field, in this case a media file, that links to an s3 amazon database or to some other third party server.Using Alpha, you can download this content to the client and then when you do go offline you can use these media files on the client-side. There might be a problem, however, if you have downloaded several files have yet to generate audio files to match the downloaded ones. If you then delete a row which is not yet whole, you will have a file that has been orphaned.</description>

    <description>Options for customizing the scroller for the list layout.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>Scroll settings for the list layout can be customized if [Custom scroll properties] has been checked. By default, the List uses momentum scrolling. The *[ui:Custom scroll properties]* allow you to turn off momentum scrolling and/or enable 'snap' scrolling, which can be used to ensure the whole list record is always visible and prevent the display of partial records.</p>

            <description>If checked, the List control will use momentum scrolling. Momentum scrolling allows the user to scroll down the list by "flicking" the list up or down. It is recommended to turn momentum scrolling off if *[ui:X axis - scroll in discrete amounts]* or *[ui:Y axis - scroll in discrete amounts]* are enabled.</description>

            <description>When drag-scrolling on the x axis, should scrolling occur in discrete amounts? For example, you might want to scroll the list by 50px at a time so that no partial rows are displayed.</description>

            <description>Specify the 'step' amount - the discrete amount by which the List is scrolled. You can specify a value in pixels, or a percentage (e.g. 100%). When you specify a percentage, the percentage is of the 'viewport' size. For example, if the 'viewport' in which the List is displayed is 300px wide, then setting the snap size to 100% is the same as setting it to 300px.</description>

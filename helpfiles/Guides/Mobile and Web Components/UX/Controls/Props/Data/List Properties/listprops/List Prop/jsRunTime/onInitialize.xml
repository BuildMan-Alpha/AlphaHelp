            <title>Resetting List State when Restoring Lists From Storage</title>
            <description>
                <p>When a List is persisted to storage, the data in the List as well as the List 'state' (i.e. client side filter, client side sorting, etc.) are also persisted.</p>
                <p>In some cases when the List is restored from storage, a Javascript error may occur when setting the List state to the persisted state. </p>
                <p>When a List is restored, you can set a flag that prevents restoring the list state (the data will still be restored):</p>
                <p>
                    <example code="xb"><![CDATA[this._restoreListState = false;]]></example>
                </p>
                <p>This flag should be specified in the list's *[ui:onInitialize]* event.</p>

    <topic>Server side afterQuery event</topic>
    <description>This server side event is available for List controls that are populated using a SQL data source. The AfterQuery event fires after the List query has been performed. The typical use case for this event is to compute some Javascript to return to the browser. For example, you might want to compute the total for a column in the List and then update some control on the screen.</description>

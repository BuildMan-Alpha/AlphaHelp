    <description>Define settings for uploading media files from the mobile device to the target server. Also define setting for downloading media files from a server to the mobile device. Files can be saved in the device's filesystem, allowing them to be accessed offline.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The Upload Target Settings Dialog allows you to define if the media files should be uploaded to the Alpha Anywhere server or to Amazon S3. It can also be used to define where media files are downloaded from and where to store them on the device. In Cordova applications, files can be stored in the device's filesystem, allowing the user to access the files when the working in offline.</p>
        <p>In the case where you are not using Cordova, you can still access photos in your data when you are offline. However, the amount of data you can load into the List will be limited because the photos are stored in Local Storage along with the List data. In order to store images in the List data so that they are available when you are offline, the photo field in your database must be a binary field (as opposed to a character field - which is required if you are using the Cordova option) and you must configure the List to embed the image data (as base64 encoded data) into the List (by checking the *[ui:Embed images into HTML property]* for the image field in the List settings, Fields pane).</p>

            <important>You must define the Upload Settings in the *[top-most]* parent List if you have a List hierarchy (i.e. a parent-child relationship between Lists with the child Lists configured to pre-fetch their data).</important>

                    <description>
                        <p>*[ui:Alpha Anywhere Server]* or *[ui:S3]*</p>
                        <p>Specify where the media files (i.e. photos) should be uploaded when data from the List are synchronized. Uploading to S3 is very efficient because the upload takes place directly from the mobile device to S3, without involving the Alpha Anywhere server.</p>
                    </description>
                    <note>When you upload to S3, the Alpha Anywhere server actually does play a very small role - before the upload to S3 starts, an Ajax callback is made to the Alpha Anywhere server to 'sign' the URL for the S3 upload using your S3 account credentials. By signing the URL on the Alpha Anywhere server, there is no need to expose your S3 credentials on the client side.</note>

                    <title nested="2">Target filename</title>
                    <description>Allows you to specify Javascript code that returns the filename of the uploaded media file when it is stored on S3 or the Alpha Anywhere server. It is very important that the target filename be unique for each uploaded media file or an upload from a user on one device could overwrite an upload from another user on a different device. The default code for this property is:</description>
                    <example code="">
                        <![CDATA[return '<DeviceId>_' +e.object.listFieldName + '_' + A5.ts() + '_' +e.name]]>
                    </example>
                </case>
                <case>
                    <description>This indicates that the name of the uploaded file on S3 or the Alpha Anywhere server will be composed of the following elements:</description>
                    <list>
                        <item>
                            <name>&lt;DeviceId&gt;</name>
                            <description>a unique id generated by the mobile device. Unfortunately, is is possible that two or more mobile devices might generate same device id.</description>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                            <name>e.object.listFieldName</name>
                            <description>name of the field in the List where the uploaded filename will be stored</description>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                            <name>e.object.listName</name>
                            <description>name of the List that contains the target field</description>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                            <name>A5.ts()</name>
                            <description>a time stamp string.</description>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                </case>
                <case>
                    <description>You can specify that the uploaded files are stored in a folder on the target by including a forward slash in the name. For example, the following Javascript stores the uploaded files from each user in separate folders:</description>
                    <example code="">
                        <![CDATA[return '<DeviceId> + '_' + e.object.ListFieldName + '/' + e.name;]]>
                    </example>
                </case>
                <case>
                    <description>In the case where you are uploading to the Alpha Anywhere server, this target filename returned by this JavaScript code can be overwritten by an Xbasic function that is called before the uploaded file is saved to disk. See information on the beforeUploadedFileSave below.</description>

                    <description>Allows you to specify if you want to display progress while media files are uploaded when data in the List are synchronized. Since you can capture a large number of photos while you are disconnected, it can be very helpful to the user to display progress while the media files are uploaded. If you check this property then additional properties are shown that allow you to indicate properties of the progress indicator.</description>

                    <description>JavaScript to execute before files are uploaded to the target server. Since uploading the media files might take some time, this event is useful because it allows you to lock the screen and put up your own wait dialog.

You can use JavaScript function to specify the folder name. Specify the  name as:</description>

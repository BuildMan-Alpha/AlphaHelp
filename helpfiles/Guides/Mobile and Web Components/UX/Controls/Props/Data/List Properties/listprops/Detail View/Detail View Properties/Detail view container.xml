        <p>If the *[ui:Detail view type]* is set to *[Container]*, the *[ui:Detail view container]* property is shown. This property defines the container in the component that holds the controls to map to the List control's fields. The controls in the container must have the same name as the List's fields. If names do not match, the fields will not be mapped.</p>

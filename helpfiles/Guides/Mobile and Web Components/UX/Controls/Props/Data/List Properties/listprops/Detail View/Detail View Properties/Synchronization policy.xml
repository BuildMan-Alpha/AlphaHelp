    <description>The 'Synchronization policy' property lets you select how you want to perform CRUD operations, like 'Save' 
        and 'Synchronize' in your list control.

        <description>For example, it is easy to add 'Save' and 'Synchronize' buttons to a list control 
        with a detail view. In this case the 'Save' button adds the edits made in the Detail View to the List control. The 'Synchronize' 
        button then pushes the changes in the List Control to the Server. Using 'Synchronization policy' you can make this 
        one step. When you click 'Save' the edits in the Detail View will automatically be added to the list control AND pushed 
        to the server, all in one go.</description>

    <description>Fires after the user has started 'pulling' a List beyond an end point, when the user restores the List to its 'non-pulled' state.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The *[js:onPullEnd]* event is triggered when the List is restored to it's "non-pulled" state without releasing the List after the user pulls the List. For example, user starts dragging down past the top of the List, and before releasing, restores the List to its natural position. In this case the 'onPullEnd' event (and NOT the 'onPullRelease' event) will fire.</p>

    <description>Fires when the user taps a List row.</description>

        <p>The *[js:onTap]* event is triggered when the user taps on a row in the List. *[js:onTap]* is very similar to *[js:onClick]*, except that if the user taps/clicks on a row and then, before releasing, moves by more than the threshold amount (default is 10px), then the onTap event will not fire.</p>
        <p>Your code can reference arguments[0]  - the zero based index of the row that was tapped.</p>

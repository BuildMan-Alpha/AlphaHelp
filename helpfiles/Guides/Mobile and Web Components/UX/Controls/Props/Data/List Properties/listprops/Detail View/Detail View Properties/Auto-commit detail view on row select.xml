        <p>The *[ui:Auto-commit detail view on row select]* property enables auto-commit for modified records when a user selects another row in a List after making some edits. When enabled, if the user changes data in the Detail View and then clicks on a different row in the List, the Detail View edits are automatically saved.</p>
        <p>If *[ui:Auto-commit detail view on row select]* is disabled, the user cannot select a different row in the List until the changes to the current record are saved or reversed. The user will be shown a message that they have existing edits that must be saved before they can navigate to another record.</p>

        <p>When a UX is running on a mobile device, the List is scrolled by dragging on the List. When running on a device that supports a mouse (e.g. a desktop browser), the List is scrolled by dragging on the vertical scrollbar.</p>
        <p>There may be cases where you want to force drag scrolling when running on a device that supports a mouse (i.e. a desktop browser). A possible reason you might want to force drag scrolling on a desktop browser is that you want to implement the 'pull to refresh' pattern to refresh the data in the List.</p>
        <p>The *[ui:Use drag scrolling]* property lets you specify if drag scrolling should always be used to scroll the List. This property has the following choices:</p>
        <p>
            <list>
                <item>
                    <name-title>Behavior</name-title>
                    <description-title>Description</description-title>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>Auto</name>
                    <description>If the user is on a touch device, drag scrolling is used. If the user is on a non-touch device (e.g. a device that doesn't support touch events), drag scrolling is not used.</description>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>Always</name>
                    <description>Drag scrolling is always used on touch and non-touch devices.</description>
                </item>
            </list>

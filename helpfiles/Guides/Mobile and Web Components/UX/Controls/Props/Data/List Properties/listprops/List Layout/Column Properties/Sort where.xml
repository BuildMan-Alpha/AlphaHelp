        <p>Data in a List control can be sorted in one of two locations. If the data shown in a List is downloaded and served locally, client-side sorting is sufficient. However, if the List Control is Paginated, sorting records on the client when the user clicks a column heading makes less sense. In this situation, you would want the list to sort on the server.</p>
        <p>Each field in the List Layout can be configured individually to sort using the following behavior:</p>
        <p>
            <list>
                <item>
                    <name-title>Option</name-title>
                    <description-title>Description</description-title>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>ClientSide</name>
                    <description>Data is sorted in the browser using JavaScript. Only data that has been downloaded to the device will be sorted.</description>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>ServerSide</name>
                    <description>A callback is made to the server to sort the data. This behavior is recommended if the List is Paginated.</description>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>Javascript</name>
                    <description>Use this option to specify your own JavaScript code to execute when the user taps on a column heading.</description>
                </item>
            </list>
        </p>

            <description>If all fields should be sorted on the server, such as in a Paginated List, the [Server-side sorting] property on the *[ui:Data Source]* tab can be used to configure all fields to sort on the server.</description>

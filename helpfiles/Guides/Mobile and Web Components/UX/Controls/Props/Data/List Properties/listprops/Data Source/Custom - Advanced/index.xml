            <description>
                <p>Xbasic functions in a UX component are usually defined in the *[ui:Xbasic functions]* section for the component. However, Xbasic can be defined as part of the List control. This allows you to store any functions used to populate the List control with the control's definition. Xbasic that is stored in the List control will be included with the List when it is copied between components.</p>

                <p>The *[ui:Xbasic code]* property opens an Xbasic editor where Xbasic functions stored with the List control can be defined.</p>

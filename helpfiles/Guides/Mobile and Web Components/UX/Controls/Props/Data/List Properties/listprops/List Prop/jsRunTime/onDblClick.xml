        <p>The *[js:onDblClick]* event is triggered when the user double clicks on a row in the List. Your code can reference *[js:arguments[0]]*, a zero based index of the row that was double clicked. In addition, the JavaScript can reference the 'this' scope, which is a pointer to the List object.</p>

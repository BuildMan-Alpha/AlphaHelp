    <description>Fires when the user 'pulls' the List beyond an end point (i.e. top, bottom, left or right edge) of the List and then releases while the List is in a 'pulled' state (allowing the List to animate back to its natural position).</description>

        <p>The *[js:onPullRelease]* event does not fire if the user restores the List to a 'non-pulled' state before releasing.</p>

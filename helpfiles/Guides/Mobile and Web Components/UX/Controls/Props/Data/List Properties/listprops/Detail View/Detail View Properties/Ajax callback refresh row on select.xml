        <p>The *[ui:Ajax callback to refresh row on select]* property, when enabled, makes a callback to the application server to fetch the data for the selected row before populating the List's Detail View. This ensures that the most up-to-date values are shown when editing a record, minimizing write conflicts when the user submits any changes back to the server.</p>
        <p>Note that making a callback to fetch data before displaying the Detail View can impact performance. If the network connection is slow, or the data definition for the List is complex, you may see a delay in your application when a row is selected.</p>
        <p>Data can only be refreshed if a connection is available. Refreshing cannot be performed if the app is offline.</p>

    <description>Fires when the List or any element in the List looses focus.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The *[ui:onFocusOut]* event fires when the List (or any of its child elements that can capture focus, such as in-place editing controls) looses focus. This differs from the onBlur event which does not fire when a child element looses focus.</p>
        <p>This event has no parameters.</p>

    <description>This is the default or global onUp event. 
        The onUp event fires when a mouse button is lifted, after an item in a viewbox is clicked 
        on. This is assuming the item in question does not have a localized onUp event as part 
        of the item's definition.

         <description>If an onUp event is tied to a
        specific item's definition, then this localized event will be used
        in place of the default. The default onUp event only fires if an item 
        does NOT contain a onUp event in the item definition.

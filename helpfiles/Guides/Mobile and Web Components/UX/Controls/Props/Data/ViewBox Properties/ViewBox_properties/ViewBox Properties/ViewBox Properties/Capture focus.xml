    <description>Controls focus capture behavior for the ViewBox and whether or not the ViewBox control should capture focus when tapped/clicked or if focus should be propagated to the HTML elements in the ViewBox layout.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The *[ui:Capture focus]* property allows you to specify if the ViewBox control can capture focus. Be default, this property is enabled. If the ViewBox layout contains standard HTML controls (such as &lt;input&gt; or &lt;textarea&gt; HTML elements) the user needs to interact with, disable the *[ui:Capture focus]* property.</p>
        <p>If *[ui:Capture focus]* is disabled, the [Allow keyboard navigation to give focus] property is exposed.</p>

    <topic>Graph minor lines</topic>
    <description>The number of minor graph lines per major graph line. Minor lines are lighter colored lines that 
        appear in cells defined by heavier major lines. By default there are no minor lines and this property is set to 0.</description>

           <description>Setting the Graph minor lines to a number will result in that number of lines being applied to each cell's x-axis and y axis.
               If this property is set to '4', for example, there will be 4 lines along the x axis of each cell and 4 lines along the y axis in each cell. 
               This will result in 16 minor cells for each major cell.

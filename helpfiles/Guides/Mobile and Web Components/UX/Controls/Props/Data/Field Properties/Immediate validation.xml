        <p>When a control with validation is edited, the validation can be applied immediately or after the data is submitted to the server. The *[ui:Immediate validation]* property defines what validation rules should be applied after the user has edited a field: *[ui:Client-side]*, *[ui:Client-side and server-side]*, or *[ui:None]* (control values are not validated after the user edits them).</p>
        <p>By default, *[ui:Immediate validation]* is set to *[ui:Client-side]*. Client-side validation rules include the *[ui:Validation rules]* and *[ui:Validation javascript]*.</p>
        <p>If you wish to also apply *[ui:Validation Xbasic]* rules, set *[ui:Immediate validation]* to *[ui:Client-side and server-side]*. When set to *[ui:Client-side and server-side]*, Alpha Anywhere makes an Ajax Callback to the server to validate the value in a control. Note that making callbacks to provide real-time validation for your application can have an impact on your app's performance. Be careful to use the *[ui:Client-side and server-side]* option only for those fields that require real-time server-side validation.</p>
        <p>If you don't want to apply any immediate validation, set *[ui:Immediate validation]* to *[ui:None]*. When set to *[ui:None]*, validation occurs when the UX component is submitted. Disabling immediate validation also disables *[ui:Validation javascript]* because the validation is done on the server using Xbasic.</p>

    <description>Specify if the value in the field should be validated as soon as you tab out of the field, or in the case of a radio button, dropdownbox, or checkbox control, as soon as you change a value. The 'server-side' option will generate an Ajax callback, so you should try to limit the number of fields that require real-time server-side validation.</description>

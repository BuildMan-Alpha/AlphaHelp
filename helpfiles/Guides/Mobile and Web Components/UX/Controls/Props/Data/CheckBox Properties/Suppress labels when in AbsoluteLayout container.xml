    <description>Specify whether or not labels should be shown when the CheckBox control is placed in an AbsoluteLayout container.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>If the CheckBox control is inside an AbsoluteLayout container, the *[ui:Suppress labels when in AbsoluteLayout container]* property can be used to prevent the control's labels from rendering. You may want ot do this if you are using a bitmap background for the AbsoluteLayout container that already has labels for the CheckBox options - such as an image of a medical form. </p>
    </discussion>
    <note>This option is only shown if the CheckBox control's choices are defined as a static list.</note>

        <p>The *[ui:OnSelect]* event can be used to specify JavaScript to execute when the value of the control changes. The value of the variable bound to the CheckBox control is changed when the user clicks an option, when the *[js:{dialog.object}.setValue()]* method is used to set the control's value, or when the value is change some other way (calculated expression, etc.)</p>
        <p>The *[ui:OnSelect]* event differs from the *[ui:OnClick]* event in that the OnClick event is only fired when the user clicks an option. The OnSelect event can be triggered by clicking it or programmatically using JavaScript.</p>

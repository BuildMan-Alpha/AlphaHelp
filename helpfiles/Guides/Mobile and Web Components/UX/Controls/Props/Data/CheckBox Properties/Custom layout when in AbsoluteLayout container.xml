        <p>Controls placed in an Absolute AbsoluteLayout container can be positioned manually to appear in a fixed location within the container. If the CheckBox control is populated with static data, the position of each check box in the control can be positioned "absolutely". An AbsoluteLayout contaienr is often used in web applications to add controls over a background image, such as a tax document or hospital form.</p>

        <p>Specify the image to showwhen the item is not selected. This is usually a null image that has the same size as the *[ui:Selected image]*. Leave this option blank to use a default image. The unselected image usually only needs to be set if a custom selected image has been chosen that is is a different size than the default selected image.</p>

    <description>Recomputes the underlying Xbasic definition for all controls in a UX Component.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>*[ui:Recalculate all controls]*, found in the UX Builder's *[ui:Menu]* (located in the Controls toolbar), recalculates the Xbasic definition for all controls in the component's layout. When used, Alpha Anywhere analyzes the UX Component's Xbasic definition and recomputing the component's layout if [Pre-render component at design-time] is enabled.</p>
        <p>When migrating a UX Component to a new version of Alpha Anywhere, *[ui:Recalculate all controls]* can be used to update a component's underlying Xbasic definition to the new version for publishing.</p>

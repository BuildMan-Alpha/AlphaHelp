        <description>A [Repeating Section] is a container that is wrapped around a series of controls. When 
            the component containing the repeating section is run, these controls are duplicated a specified 
            number  of times within the component. In this way, repeating sections can cause the component 
            to appear like a detail form or an invoice page. In addition to controls, you can also add this defined 
            'Row Number' control inside the repeating section. This will cause each row in the
             repeating section to be numbered if the [Has row number] checkbox in the [Repeating Section Properties] 
             is checked.</description>

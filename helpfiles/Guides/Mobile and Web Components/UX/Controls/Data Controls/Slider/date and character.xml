        <p>The slider control by default allows you to select a numeric value in a range of numbers. But it can also be configured to select a date value from a range of date values, or a string value from a pre-defined list of choices (e.g. Poor, Average, Good).</p>
        <p>This video below shows how to configure a Slider control as a numeric, character or date slider. It also shows how the range of allowed values (numeric and date sliders) or the list of choices (character sliders) can be dynamically changed at run-time.</p>

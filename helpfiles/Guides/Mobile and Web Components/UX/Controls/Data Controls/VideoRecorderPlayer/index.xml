                <p>You may have noticed that there are several video player controls in the UX component. The *[ui:VideoRecorderPlayer]* control shown above (found in the *[ui:More...]* controls dialog in the *[ui:Data Controls]* section) can be used to add a video player to a component that is data-bound and will operate in a disconnected environment. The *[ui:VideoRecorderPlayer]* can also record video in a Cordova mobile application.</p>

                <p>The term "Data-bound" means that the control reads its data, in this case the location of a video file, from a database on a server. The data is loaded from the server to the client, such as a mobile phone.</p>
                <p>The term 'Disconnected' refers to the fact that the user's device does not need to have a continuous connection to the server in order for the application function.</p>
                <p>The data-bound *[ui:VideoRecorderPlayer]* control allow users to playback existing videos and record new videos in Cordova mobile applications.</p>
                <p>Event definitions for the data bound *[ui:VideoRecorderPlayer]* control can be set using the [Control properties] property.</p>

            <description>
                <p>JavaScript methods are available for the *[ui:VideoRecorderPlayer]* control. Methods can be used for recording and playback. To call the methods, you must first get a reference to the JavaScript object for the *[ui:VideoRecorderPlayer]* control using the [{dialog.object}.getControl()] method:</p>
                <p>
                    <example code="js">
                <![CDATA[//Get a pointer to the VideoRecorderPlayer control with the ID 'VIDEO_CONTROL':
var videoObj = {dialog.object}.getControl('VIDEO_CONTROL');

if (videoObj) {
    // Pause the video
    videoObj.pause();
}]]>
            </example>
                </p>
                <p>See [Video Player methods] for *[ui:VideoRecorderPlayer]* control methods.</p>

                <title>Dyamically Repopulating Chocies in a RadioButton or CheckBox Control</title>
                <description>
                    <p>In some applications, it might be necessary to repopulate the choices shown in a RadioButton or CheckBox control with a new set of choices after the UX Component has initially been rendered. An Ajax callback is made where the new choices are computed on the server, then a Javascript response is sent to the browser to update the choices for the control. These videos show how this can be done.</p>
                    <p>In part 2, the CheckBox is populated with a much larger set of choices and a snaking layout (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) for the CheckBox control is specified.</p>

                <note>The video shows an example for a CheckBox, but the same principle applies to radio buttons. The only difference is that the *[link:a5w_radiobuttons() function@api a5w radiobuttons function]* would be used on the server to compute the HTML for a RadioButton control</note>        </section>

                <title>RadioButton and CheckBox Controls - Displaying as Button Lists</title>
                <description>In mobile applications, the standard HTML RadioButton and CheckBox controls are not optimal for touch events. The UX builder makes it very easy to render RadioButton and CheckBox options as a button list instead of the standard HTML controls. In this video, we show how this is easily done. </description>

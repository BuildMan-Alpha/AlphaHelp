    <topic>Image - Data Bound</topic>
    <description>Places a data-bound image control on the component. Data-bound means that the image data it tied, or 
        bound, to a server-side database. The images on the server can then be used to populate the image data displayed 
        on a client-side device, like a mobile phone. 
        Images that are not data-bound can be add to a component using the [Image] control in the other controls section.

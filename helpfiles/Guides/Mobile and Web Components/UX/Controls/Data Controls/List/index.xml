            <description>For components that use a list control along with tens or hundreds of additional controls, pairing a list control with a [FormView control] is a convenient way to save on run-time memory. Doing this can also eliminate many interface problems caused by certain operating systems. See also the [List Properties] section of the  documentation and the properties pages for the [List Builder].</description>

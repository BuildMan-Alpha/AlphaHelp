        <p>The CheckBox control can be displayed as a single logical check box or a list of choices that is statically or dynamically populated. Configuring a CheckBox control is similar to configuring a RadioButton. The main difference between the two control types is that a RadioButton can only have one value while a CheckBox control can have multiple values.</p>

Add articles here from video library that are specific to the checkbox control
Add reference to the RadioButton Control articles - possibly shorten the articles so that they are generic and apply to both the CheckBox and RadioButton

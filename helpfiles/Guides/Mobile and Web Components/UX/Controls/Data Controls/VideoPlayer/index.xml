                <p>You may have noticed that there are several video player controls in the UX component. The VideoPlayer control shown above (found in the 'Data Controls' menu) can be used to add a video player to a component that is data-bound and will operate in a disconnected environment.</p>

                <p>The term "Data-bound" means that the control reads its data, in this case the location of a video file, from a database on a server. The data is loaded from the server to the client, such as a mobile phone.</p>
                <p>The term 'Disconnected' refers to the fact that the user's device does not need to have a continuous connection to the server in order for the application function.</p>
                <p>The data-bound VideoPlayer control will only allow users to playback existing videos. To give users the ability to record videos use the [Video Recorder/Player] control.</p>
                <p>Event definitions for the data bound VideoPlayer control can be set using the '[Control properties]' property.</p>

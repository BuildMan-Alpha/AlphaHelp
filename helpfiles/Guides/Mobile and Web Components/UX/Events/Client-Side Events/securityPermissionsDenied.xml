    <description>This event is executed if an Ajax callback returns with a 403 status code.</description>
    <discussion>If the server sends back a '403' status code in the response, the securityPermissionsDenied event will fire. To use this event, you must set the [Security permissions denied action] property in the *[ui:Other]* section of the UX properties to *[ui:Fire client-side security events]*.</discussion>
    <note>You can manually set the status code in an Ajax response (for example, if you want to test the events), by setting the [Context.Response.StatusCode] property in the Xbasic function that handles the Ajax callback. See [How to Return Status Codes from Ajax Callbacks] for more information.</note>

    <description>Fires after a UX Component has been synchronized. (When a button opens a Dialog 
        in a Window, and if the 'caching' option is on, if the window has been previously instantiated, 
        the existing Dialog in the window is simply synchronized rather than loaded from scratch). Since the Dialog 
        is not being loaded from scratch, the OnDialogInitialize event will not fire. You can execute initialization 
        code in this event. The 'obj' parameter contains the Javascript object passed into the .synchronizeDialog() method.

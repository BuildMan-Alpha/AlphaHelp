    <topic>About Using jQuery in Working Preview</topic>
    <description>In some situations, jQuery is not loaded when testing a UX Component in Working Preview. When this happens, the UX component may not behave as expected. To work around this limitation, using Chrome in Working Preview, using Live Preview, or publishing to local host can be used in lieu of Working Preview to test a component. Alternatively, the internal jQuery library can be manually loaded using an Ajax callback.</description>

                <p>If you need to have jQuery loaded while you are in Working Preview then you can either switch to Chrome for Working Preview, or change where jQuery is loaded from.</p>

For example, you could use the following Xbasic function to handle the Ajax callback that loads the internal version of jQuery.</p>

    <discussion>
        <p>The *[ui:PhoneGap - iPhone X Styling]* template is a sample iOS component to demonstrate iPhone X styling and use of the status bar plugin within a PhoneGap app. Applications built for iPhone X must take into account the 'notch' at the top of the device where the status bar is located. Apps must also accommodate the home button, which is located at the bottom of the screen.</p>
        <p>For full instructions on using this template and styling apps for iPhone X, see [Styling a PhoneGap App for the iPhone X].</p>

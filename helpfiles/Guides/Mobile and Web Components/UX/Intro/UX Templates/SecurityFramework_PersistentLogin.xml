    <discussion>
        <p>This template demonstrates how to create a mobile application that does not require the user to log in every time they use the application. After the user logs in for the first time, a special token called a "JavaScript Web Token" or "JWT" is created and stored on the device. After the token has been created, the user does not need to login again until the token expires or their account is revoked.</p>

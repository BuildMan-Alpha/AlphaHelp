			<title>D6 - Repeating Sections</title>
			<description>
				<p>Number D6. The UX Component can be used for 'Master-Detail' style forms. This is done by putting a 'Repeating Section' on the UX. Any controls that are inside the 'Repeating Section' will repeat as many times as you specify. At runtime, when the user is filling in the form, they can click a button to add a new row to the Repeating Section if they need more rows.</p>
				<p>This video shows how you can create a simple invoice form with a Repeating Section. The video then shows how you can define client-side calculated fields to show the extended total (Price * Quantity) for each row as data is entered and also client-side summary fields that sum the extended total for all of the rows in the Repeating Section.</p>

			<title>D7 - Submitting Data</title>
			<description>
				<p>Number D7. This video shows how you can put a button on the UX to submit the data in the UX component to the server and then how the AfterDialogValidate event is fired where your Xbasic code can handle the event. </p>
				<p>Typically, your Xbasic event handler would save the submitted data to a table. You are free to write your own code to perform this task, or you can use Server-Side Action Scripting to write the code for you (as shown in a subsequent video)</p>

			<title>D8 - Validating Data</title>
			<description>
				<p>Number D8. The UX component has an extremely rich set of features for validating data in the component. Validation rules can be defined declaratively, or using code (either Javascript for client-side, or Xbasic for server-side). Validation rules are evaluated on the client where possible (thus eliminating the need for an Ajax callback). Validation rules can be set to fire when the component is submitted, or immediately, when the user tabs out of a field.</p>
				<p>These videos discuss the various validation options in the UX component.</p>

			<title>D9 - Genie Style</title>
			<description>
				<p>Number D9. When building UX Components that have a large number of fields, it is common to present the controls to the user in 'genie' or 'wizard' style. In this style 'page 1' of the UX is shown, with a next button at the bottom of the UX. When the user has entered data into the controls on page 1, pressing Next moves to page 2, and so on.</p>
				<p>Typically, the user cannot move to the next page until the data on the current page has been validated.</p>
				<p>This video shows how easy it is to create 'Genie' style UX components.</p>

			<title>D10 - Data Binding - Creating Tables to Match the UX Layout</title>
			<description>
				<p>Number D10. When you create a UX component, you will often want to store the data the user submits in a table. In some cases, when you design the UX, you will already have an existing table. However, there may be cases where you design the UX first, and only then create the table into which the data will be stored.</p>
				<p>These videos show how you can design a UX component, and then automatically create one or more tables to match the structure of your UX component.</p>

			<title>D11 - Data Binding - Binding to Existing Tables</title>
			<description>
				<p>Number D11. After you create a UX component, you may want to 'bind' the controls in the UX to one or more existing tables so that you can use Server-side Action Scripting to automatically enter data into tables.</p>
				<p>(You can't use Server-side Action Scripting until you have first 'bound' the UX to tables).</p>
				<p>In this video we show how you can bind the controls in a UX to a table. </p>
				<p>Once the controls have been bound, we then show how you can use Server-side Action Scripting to enter or edit records in the table.</p>

			<title>D13 - Repeating Sections - Scrollable Containers</title>
			<description>
				<p>Number D13. If you have a Repeating Section in a UX, you can put buttons below the Repeating Section to add or remove rows from the Repeating Section. When you add or remove rows, all of the controls on the UX that are below the Repeating Section will move up and down as the size of the Repeating Section changes. You might prefer to put the Repeating Section in a fixed size, scrollable container. When you scroll this container however, you want the titles for each column in the Repeating Section to remain fixed.</p>
				<p>This video shows how this is easily done.</p>

For example, assume that you have built a component with many controls and you would like to wrap all of the control labels in language tags ( and ), so that you can internationalize your component.</p>
				<p>In the video we show how this is easily done</p>
			</description>
			<note>The feature shown here in the UX Component also applies to the Grid component.			</note>

			<title>D19 - Field Level Validation in the DialogValidate Event</title>
			<description>
				<p>Number D19. By default, when you execute validation code in the DialogValidate event and you want to display a validation error to the user, the error text is displayed in a message area above the UX. This is different than Field Level validation errors, which are displayed next to the field in error. Field Level validation rules are defined at the Control level in the UX Builder.</p>
				<p>Howerver, in some cases it is more convenient to put all of your validation logic in the DialogValidate event, but still be able to show errors next to the fields in error, rather than in the message area at the top of the UX.</p>
				<p>This video shows how you can defined field level validation in the DialogValidate event.</p>

			<title>D22 - Sending E-mail From a UX component</title>
			<description>
				<p>Number D22. A very common pattern in Web Applications is to display a form to capture some information (for example, name and address information), and then when the user clicks on the Submit button, store the submitted data in a table and then send an e-mail confirmation to the user.</p>
				<p>This can be easily done with the UX component. Using Server-side Action Scripting, the entire process can be handled without having to write any code. The Alpha Anywhere Genies will write all of the code for you.</p>
				<p>The videos show how the email message can be sent immediately, or queued in a 'WorkQueue' table.</p>

			<title>D27 - Using Action Javascript to Lock the Page, or a Portion of the Page During an Ajax Callback</title>
			<description>
				<p>Number D27. A common requirement in Ajax applications is to 'lock' the screen, or a portion of the screen, for the duration of the callback. This prevents the user from performing some action that is not appropriate during a callback. A transparent overlay is displayed over the screen or element to 'lock' it.</p>
				<p>In this video we show how you can use Action Javascript to lock either the entire screen, or a portion of the screen.</p>
			</description>
			<note>The video shows how this is done in a UX component, but the technique applies equally well to a Grid component.		</note>

			<title>D28 - Using a UX component as an Alternate Editing View of a Record in a Grid</title>
			<description>
				<p>Number D28. If you have a lot of columns in an updateable Grid, it can be cumbersome to scroll horizontally when editing data in the Grid. In this video we show how a UX component can be used to edit the data in the Grid row. A button can be inserted into the Grid row. When the button is clicked, the UX component is opened and the current data in the Grid row is filled into the UX Component. The user can then continue editing in the UX, and then click an Update button, which closes the UX and fills in the controls in the row in the Grid that is being edited. You can toggle instantly between the Grid view and the UX view of the data.</p>
				<p>(Contrast the behavior in this video with that of video D24. In D24, the UX Component is more than just an alternate editing view - it is responsible for saving the edits to the database. In this video, the UX is not responsible for saving data to the database - it is merely an alternate view of the data you are editing).</p>

			<title>D37 - Opening a Component and then Executing Javascript Code in the Target Component - Circumventing the Asynchronous Nature of Ajax Callbacks. </title>
			<description>
				<p>Number D37. Often, when using Action Javascript, you might define an action to open a component (say a Grid or a UX Component) and then you might define a subsequent action to perform some command on the component you just opened. This does not work because the second action executes before the first action has completed - since the first action is an Ajax callback, and it is therefore asynchronous.</p>
				<p>These videos show a technique that you can use to work around the asynchronous nature of Ajax callbacks.</p>

			<title>D39 - Understanding what's in the e.dataSubmitted and e.oldDataSubmitted Objects when the UX Component is Submitted. </title>
			<description>Number D39. When a UX is submitted, the data in the component are submitted in the e.dataSubmitted object. In addition, the original data that was in the UX Component when the UX was originally opened are in the e.oldDataSubmitted objected. In some cases the developer will allow the UX Component to be submitted multiple times and might want to re-initialize the UX so that each time the UX is submitted, the data in the e.oldDataSubmitted object are the data that was in the UX the previous time it was submitted, and not when the UX was initially displayed. </description>

	<topic>TabbedUI Object - Method to Select the Active Pane</topic>

	<section>
			<example><![CDATA[tbiObj.selectPane('Customers'); ]]></example>
		
	</section>

		<description>In this example, the name of the pane has been hard-coded. In a real application, the pane to be selected would save its name in a JavaScript variable on initialization, and the button event handler that performs the action would reference that variable.

   <description><![CDATA[If an .a5w page contains a Tabbed UI Component then that page cannot contain any other component. This is different from other component types. For example, an .a5w page might contain two Grid components. Because .a5w pages that contain Tabbed UI Components are special, they are created automatically for you when the Tabbed UI Component is saved. You can specify the name of the .a5w page that is automatically created or you can let Alpha Five name it for you (the builder will create a page called 'TabbedUI_<ComponentName>.a5w').]]></description>

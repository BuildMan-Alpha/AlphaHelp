<description>If you are displaying a Grid component in a Linked Content Section, and if the child Grid contains a pop-up HTML memo editor, the Linked Content Grid must be placed in the Master Template or a Search Part free-form edit region. The HTML editor will not function correctly if the Linked Content is placed in the Grid part's or Detail View part's free-form edit region.</description>

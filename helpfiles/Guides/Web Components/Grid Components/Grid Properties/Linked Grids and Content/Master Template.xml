<description>You can place Linked Content Sections in the Master Template. Previously, Linked Content Sections could only be placed in a Free-form edit region. The benefit of placing Linked Content Sections in the Master Template is that you get smoother repainting of the Linked Content when the parent Grid is navigated, searched, or sorted.</description>

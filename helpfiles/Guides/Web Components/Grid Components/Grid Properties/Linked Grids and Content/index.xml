   <description>When you are designing a grid, you can embed a 'Linked Grid' object or objects inside the grid part just as you would any other object (such as Tabs, Images, Frames, etc..).</description>

	<description>If you specify more than one Grid, the linked grids will display in a tab or accordion control. Linked grids can be linked to one or more fields in the current row. While they might sound mundane, linked grids have some powerful applications. If you are building a business application, for example, it is possible to link one customer on a grid containing customer names to a second grid containing information about everything that a customer has ever ordered from a given company. One could even create a third linked grid to display all of the other customers in the customer grid who happen to live in the same country.Â   </description>

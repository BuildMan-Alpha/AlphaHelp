<description>Linked Content Sections allow you to display linked data in your Grid.</description>

		<description>The linked content is displayed in a Tab or Accordion control if the Linked Content Section links more than one object. Linked Content Sections essentially duplicate the functionality of the Tabbed Grid Linker component and the Grid Linker component (from V9 and prior version). But because Linked Content Sections use Ajax, they don't have the performance penalty that Tabbed Grid Linkers and Grid Linkers have. You can place as many Linked Content Sections onÂ your Grid as you want. For example, you might have a Customer Grid with a Linked Content Section below the Grid that displays an Orders Grid (showing orders for the selected Customer) and a Payments Grid (showing payments received from the selected Customer). These two Grids would be displayed in a Tab or Accordion control. Then, you might have another Grid (displayed, say, to the right of the Customer Grid) showing a list of all documents/letters/proposals, etc. that have been sent to the selected customer. NOTE: At present, you can only place Grids in Linked Content Sections. We will add .a5w pages and other web pages in the future.
The image below shows the Customer Grid with a Linked Content Section showing the Orders Grid. This Grid, in-turn, has its own Linked Content Section which shows the Order Details Grid.

		<description>After you have defined the linked content, you must then specify where on the Grid the linked content should appear. You do this by placing a special placeholder in one of the Grid's freeform edit regions.
To place the linked content, click the 'Edit Freeform Edit Region' button and select which freeform edit region you want to use.
Then, insert the placeholder into the freeform html.

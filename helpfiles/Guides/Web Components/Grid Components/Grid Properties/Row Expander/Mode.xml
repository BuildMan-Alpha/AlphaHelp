	<description>The ModeÂ property determines how the action expanding one row affects the other rows in a grid. If the 'Mode' property is set to 'Single', then only one row can be expanded at a time. If a row is expanded and you expand another row, the currently expanded row will be collapsed. Multiple records can have their row expanded, allowing the user to view additional information about multiple records.

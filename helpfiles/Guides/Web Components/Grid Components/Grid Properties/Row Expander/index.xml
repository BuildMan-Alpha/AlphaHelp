   <description>Once your grid separated into different groups, you might want to add the ability to expand and contract those groups. This might allow users to move through the records in your grid in your more quickly and can free up space on the screen. This section allows you to design the Row Expander in your grid and how you want it to look and operate.</description>

   		<p>The row expander is a method to show information related to a record on a row. A column is added with a 'plus' icon that can be selected to 'expand the row'. A minus icon will be shown after the row is expanded that can be selected to close the expanded row. There are 2 row expander types.</p>
		<p>The 'LinkedGrids' option allows selecting one or more grid components that can be linked to the current record in the row. The linked grids can be shown in tabs, or an accordion control.</p>
		<p>The 'CustomEvent' will cause the grid event 'OnExpandRow' to fire. This event sets a number of properties such as e.html and e.javascript. The contents of the expanded row will be set to e.html. If the e.javascript is not null, the javascript contained in this property will be executed. There are other optional properties available to allow a developer to create a custom display that can be linked to the current record.</p>
		<p>Multiple records can have their row expanded, allowing the user to view additional information about multiple records.</p>
		<p>If the 'Mode' property is set to 'Single', then only one row can be expanded at a time. If a row is expanded and you expand another row, the currently expanded row will be collapsed.</p>

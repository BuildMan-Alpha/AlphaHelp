   <description>The Record Navigator lets you design how users to move through the records shown in your application. It also lets you change the appearance of the navigation part of your grid. If you want your record navigator to take the form of a tree-control there is a section in the properties for this here. Included in the Record Navigator properties is the Help Window property. This will allow you to build Help for your application, check out this page to see more information on building a Help system.

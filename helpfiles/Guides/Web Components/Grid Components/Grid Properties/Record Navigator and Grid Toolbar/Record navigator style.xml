	<description>There are three styles that the Record navigator supports, NavigationButtons, FetchMoreRecordsButton, and PullUpTouchEvent. NavigationButtons are a series of buttons that help users sift through pages of data, usually by clicking forward and back. You can decide the layout of the buttons themselves in the Record Navigator Layout property. The FetchMoreRecordsButton property is designed for use with mobile devices. This is a single button that appears on your grid. Every time the button is pushed additional pages are tacked on to the existing grid page, such that it appears to grow. The actual 'More Records' button can be altered once the FetchMoreRecordsButton property is selected. The PullUpTouchEvent is also used in mobile devices but is designed specifically to work with swipe gestures. There is no button for users to press with the PullUpTouchEvent property.</description>

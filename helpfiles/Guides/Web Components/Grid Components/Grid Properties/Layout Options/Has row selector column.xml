	<topic>Has row selector column</topic>
	<description>This property specifies if the grid has a single column containing a row selector. The row selector indicates which row in the grid is currently selected. The row selector normally appears as a small triangle on the left side of the grid. If your grid is updateable and only allows users to input data, not read existing data, then the row selector will appear as a small asterisk.

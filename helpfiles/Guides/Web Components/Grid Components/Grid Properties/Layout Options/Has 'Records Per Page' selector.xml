<description>This is different from actually setting the number of rows that initially appear in your grid. The selector is shown at the bottom of the page and has a dropdown list with the values specified in the 'Records Per Page' selector choices. When the user selects a new value, the grid refreshes and shows the number of rows selected. This option allows the grid to open with a limited number of rows and take up less space on a page. It has the added advantage of allowing the user to decide how many rows they wish to view.

	<topic>Rows of data when search active</topic>
	<description>Use this property to specify the number of rows to show in the Grid when a search (done in the Search Part) is active. Set to -1 to show the same number of rows as specified in the 'Rows of the data' property. Set to 0 to show all the records in the current query. The 'Maximum number of records per page' property will still apply.

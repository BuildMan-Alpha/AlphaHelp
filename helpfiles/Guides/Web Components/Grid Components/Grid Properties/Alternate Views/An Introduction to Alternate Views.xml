	  <topic>An Introduction to Alternate Views.</topic>

   <description>The tabular and columnar views of a grid can convey a lot of information, but the human eye is much more sensitive to shapes and colors than it is to variations text. With an alternate view of a grid, you can display the same information in a way that grabs the users attention.</description>

		<description>If it's geographic information, the best display might be a map. If it's scheduling information, the best display might be a calendar. Alternate views display the same number of rows as its associated grid. This is in contrast to a Linked component or a component in a Row Expander, both of which display data linked to or contained in the current row. The alternate view and the main view in your grid are given the same data. If your grid has a filter, it will also apply to the alternate view. If your grid is displaying 10 records on a page, the alternate view will display the same 10 records. </description>

It then examines the Alternate View Builder, looking first at the Main View properties that are the standard settings for all Alternate Views in the Grid Part of a component.

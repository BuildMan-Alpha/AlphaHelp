   <description>Grids have a property called 'Alternate Views'. An Alternate View is simply another way of displaying the data in the Grid. You can define custom Alternate View (using Xbasic), or you can use one of the built-in Alternate Views. The most commonly used built-in Alternate View is a Google Map. This is used to plot the data displayed in the Grid as markers on a Google Map. </description>

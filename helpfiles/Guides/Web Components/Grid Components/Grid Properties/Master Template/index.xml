<description>A master layout template allows you to quickly adjust the layout of the various pieces of the Grid component (i.e. Search Part, Grid Part and Detail View Part). If you don't use a master layout template, then you have to arrange the layout of the Grid parts in the .a5w page that contains the component.

<description>If you want to run a Grid with an Ajax callback you should use a master layout template. Otherwise, Alpha Anywhere will use a default master layout template.  
Using a template allows you to layout the different parts of the Grid in the component definition, rather than on the page. Several different template styles are available, such as tabs and accordions. The Detail View includes a toolbar that allows you to navigate from record to record. The text on the tabs or labels can be specified, and the initial pane to show can be specified.  </description>

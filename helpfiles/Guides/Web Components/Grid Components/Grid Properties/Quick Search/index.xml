   <description>Quick Search allows you to create a search inside of your grid. This feature is different from the Search part that you create on the Component Type page by clicking Grid contains a 'Search' part. Because the Quick Search is part of the grid, its properties are defined here as well. Selecting the Has Quick Search property adds a single search control to your grid part. If you want to add a control at the top of each field in your grid, check out the Query by Example properties.
 If you include a Search Part in addition to a Quick Search, then the Search Part will perform searches within the subset of records selected by the Quick Search.

<description>When a Grid is rendered it can be useful to break the Grid up into logical sections by inserting Group Breaks with group headers and/or footers into the Grid. If you had a number of customers across the US that you wanted to visually group by state, for example, a group break could help you create state headers within your grid. This section contains all the properties that allow you to define group breaks for different grids.

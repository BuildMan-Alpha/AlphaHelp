		<description>Different menus will appear or disappear, depending on the options that you select. Most of these Dependencies are determined under the Component Type page. If you click Grid is: Updateable under component type, for example, the ' Update Settings ' Page will appear under the Grid tree. However, setting your grid to this will prevent you from checking off the ' Grid contains a 'Detail View' part ' check box; that is also located on the Component Type page. Without this box checked the Detail View options, show below, will not appear under the Component Type tree menu.  </description>

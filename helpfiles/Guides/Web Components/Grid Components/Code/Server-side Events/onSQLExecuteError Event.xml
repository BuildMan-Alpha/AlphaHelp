   <description>In a Grid component against a SQL database, when you do an Insert, Update, or Delete, the SQL Database might send back an error. 
	   Typically the error message is not very friendly. 
	   The onSQLExecuteError event allows you to intercept the error and show a friendlier error to the user.</description>

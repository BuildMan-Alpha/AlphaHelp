		<note>Although a grid starts out as updateable, it can still be read only. This has the virtue of using text boxes instead of labels to represent the data in the grid, which in turn provides more reliable formatting alternatives, as well as the ability to copy data from the fields. 
If you change a grid that started out as updateable to read only, you will have to manually reset the grid field control types to label. 
If the grid is updateable, you may also disable the update properties of any particular field.</note>

<description>When creating a Detail View, it is necessary to have a unique key for each record. Thus, if you are going to have a Detail View, you must:
</description>
		<steps>
			<step>
				<description>Add your key field into the Selected Fieldslist.
</description>
			</step>
			<step>
				<description>Select the control that contains the key field and change its Display Settings > Control typeto "Link".

			</step>
			<step>

		<description>There are two other special fields named and that can identify a record's position in the grid and in the current query. However, in a multi-user environment, cannot be relied upon to provide a consistent link to the target record. In this case you would want to create an expression based on two or more fields in the source table and use this expression as the Hyperlinkfield of the Detail View properties page.

<description>The Lookup property allows you retrieve one or more field values from another grid. Your grid must be Updateable before you can add a Lookup property. You can set a field to be updateable from the the grid Fields page by clicking the (editable?) checkbox above the Selected: fields list. Lookups open in an Ajax window. This makes the lookup perform quickly and causes the Lookup window to open on the page, without requiring a new Browser window. Because of Ajax, popup blockers will not prevent the Lookup from opening.  

When you check the checkbox next to the Lookup property, you will notice that two additional properties appear. These are the Lookup Type and Lookup definition properties.

<description>Lookup Type has a dropdown select list with these options: Grid Component , Auto-Suggest List , and Edit-Combo List . The  Auto-Suggest list option creates Lookups that function much like a Google search toolbar. </description>

		<description>As you start typing into a textbox, a list of suggestions is supplied. With Grid Component Lookups, the suggestions can come from either a static list of values or, more commonly, from a table. For more on auto-suggest fields watch this video or this short  video . Both the Auto-suggest and edit-combo controls allow you to enter multiple values in the field you are editing. For example, say you have a field called 'Send to' and you want to support a comma delimited list, such as 'Smith,Jones,King,Cohen' and you want the user to be able to select each entry in the list from the pick list. The edit-combo, or auto-suggest control can be used for this; video. For more on edit combo boxes you can check out this video  and also this video on edit-combo box fields and how you can include edit-combo boxes in your grid components.

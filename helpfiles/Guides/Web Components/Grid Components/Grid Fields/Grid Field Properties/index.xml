   <description>To display an individual field's Properties menu simply select that field in the Selected: Fields list. The properties for each field control you select are defined on the right side of the screen. These Field Properties change depending on the control selected, whether that control is editable or not, and the nature of the grid layout selected. The default values for these properties produce a useable starting configuration for your grid. This means that you can largely ignore these optional properties when you are learning to build grids or you expect to gradually refine your design in later revisions.</description>

These include Categorized , the default, which displays menu options in groups; Alphabetical , which displays all menu options in a single alphabetized group; The Toolbar visible option, which displays buttons that switch between Categorized and Alphabetical display modes; and the Help visible option, which displays help for the currently selected property at the bottom of the property menu

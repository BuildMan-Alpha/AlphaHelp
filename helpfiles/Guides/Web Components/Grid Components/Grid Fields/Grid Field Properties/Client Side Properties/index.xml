		<note>The Client-side expressions that are used to define Client side properties can reference system fields. System fields are fields that are inherent inside Alpha Anywhere and that are not defined in the Query table you are using to access your data. Using these references can be used make your expressions more dynamic and can be used with different types of data. For example, grid.rowIsCheckedis a logical system field that will return true if the current row is checked. grid.checkedRowCountis a numeric system field that holds a count of the number of checked rows.  </note>

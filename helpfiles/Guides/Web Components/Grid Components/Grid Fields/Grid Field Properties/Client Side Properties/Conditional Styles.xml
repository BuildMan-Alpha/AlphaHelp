	<description>This makes it possible to dynamically style controls without having to make Ajax callbacks. For example, if a user enters an exceedingly large value into a Quantity field, the entry can immediately be displayed in red to show it is too big. In contrast to 'client-side' conditional styles, 'server-side' conditional styles use conditions that are expressed using Xbasic expressions. These conditions are then evaluated on the server. This [video] shows how client-side conditional styles can be used to display a different font and background color depending for different ranges of values.</description>

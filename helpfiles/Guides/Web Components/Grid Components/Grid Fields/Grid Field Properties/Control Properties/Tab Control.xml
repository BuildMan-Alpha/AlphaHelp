		<description>You can now animate the tab and accordion controls in the Grid component. 

You can control the animation method to hide and show panes. The animation methods are 'slide' and 'fade'. You can use one method to show the pane, and another method to hide the pane. For example, you might choose to 'slide' the pane into view, but 'fade' it out of view. </description>

<description>If you are creating an Updateable grid you can check the HTML editor property checkbox and add an HTML editor to your grid. This will allow users to easily add HTML to their records. If you want to add this property to a number of fields then you will need to go to Display Settings in the Field Properties list and  change the Control Type for each field to TextArea . After creating a second TextArea control, simply check the HTML property again for that control, or use the eyedroppertool.

		<description>The HTML editor comes with a number of additional properties. HTML editor width defines the width between columns that the unopened editor fills. Similarly HTML editor height specifies the row height of the unopened editor. These properties are for the default editor, where a user clicks on a given TextArea control to open the HTML editor for that record. However, you can also define a Popup mode by checking the HTML editor is popup property checkbox. When you add a popup HTML editor to the Grid, to edit HTML fields, the data in the Grid is not saved when the user closes the popup HTML editor. The data is only saved when the user clicks the Submit button. The Save grid data when closing popup editor property allows you to automatically submit the data in the Grid as soon as the popup HTML editor is closed.

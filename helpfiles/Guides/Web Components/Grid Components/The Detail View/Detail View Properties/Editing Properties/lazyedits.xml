   <description>If lazy edit is selected, when you put a row into edit mode, the database will not be queried to get current data. This makes it quicker to switch to edit mode. However, if 'RefreshRowOnDirty' is enabled, as soon as the user starts editing the row, the data in the row will be refreshed.</description>

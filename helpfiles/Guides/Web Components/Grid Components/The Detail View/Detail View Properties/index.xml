	<description>The Detail View Properties page in the Design tab contains many of the same properties found on the Grid Properties page. Here you can set the title of the Detail View, add Help windows for any field you like, add action buttons that link to action Javascript, implement security options for your Detail View, shape the appearance of your Detail View, and much more.

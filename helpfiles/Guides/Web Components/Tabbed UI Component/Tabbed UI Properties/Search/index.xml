   <description>If a TabbedUI component has a large number of items, it can be difficult for a user to find the item that they want. The search feature allow users to quickly find the items in the Tabbed UI interface. As the user types into the search box a filtered list of the matching items is displayed.</description>

                <title>Adding a Search Feature to the TabbedUI</title>
                <description>
                    <p>It is not uncommon for developers to create TabbedUI components with a very large number of items. Users may then struggle to find a particular item in the list of available menu items. Adding a search feature to the TabbedUI component makes it very easy for users to find the menu item they want.</p>
                    <p>In this video we show how the search feature is added to the TabbedUI component.</p>

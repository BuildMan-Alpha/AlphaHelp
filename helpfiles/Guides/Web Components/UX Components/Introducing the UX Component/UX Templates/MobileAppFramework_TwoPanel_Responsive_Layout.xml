    <description>A framework for a responsive mobile application with two panels.</description>
    <discussion>This template can be used to create a mobile app with a responsive two-panel layout. If the screen is wide enough, the 'left' and 'right' Panel cards are both shown. Otherwise, only the 'left' Panel is shown. To display the 'right' panel, the user must invoke an action to show the 'right' Panel.</discussion>

        <description>For example, if the form fields on a Panel have been edited, but not yet committed, you might want to prevent the Panel from losing focus. This is much like preventing a pop-up window that contains a Grid or UX component from closing if the child component has been edited.
If the Javascript that you define in the onBeforePanelActivate event returns false, then any attempt to activate another Panel will fail and focus will remain on the Panel that currently has focus. If the event returns true, then you will be able to give focus to another Panel.

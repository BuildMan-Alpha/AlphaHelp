    <description>Assign a unique id (a GUID) to each unique instance of this component. For example, 
        if you are running this component in multiple browsers, or on multiple devices, each instance 
        will have its own ID. The instance ID is stored in LocalStorage. A one-time Ajax callback 
        is made to the server to assign the instance ID.

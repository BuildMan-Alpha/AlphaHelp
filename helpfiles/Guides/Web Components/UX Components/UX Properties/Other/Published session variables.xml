    <description>By default, client-side expressions cannot see session variables. However, you can specify 
        that select session variables should be 'published' to the client so that they can be referenced in the 
        client-side expressions used in calculated fields, show/hide expressions, enable expressions, 
        dynamic images, and conditional style expressions.

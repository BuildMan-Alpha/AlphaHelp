    <topic>Compute data binding code at design time</topic>
    <description>Generally, when a UX component is bound to tables, the data binding code 
        is computed at run-time. In large UX components this can slow down the initial load 
        of the UX component. Therefore, you might prefer to compute the data binding code at 
        design-time. However, if you choose this option, saving the UX component in the 
        UX component Builder after you make an edit, this will take slightly longer.

    <description>Display a confirmation prompt before computing the data binding code. 
        If your UX is bound to a complex data structure, computing the data binding code 
        can be relatively time consuming. If you have made minor edits to the UX that do not 
        affect any of the data binding, you will not need to recompute the data binding code 
        each time you save the UX in the builder. The prompt is displayed below. This property is only available when the 'Compute data 
        binding code at design time' property is checked.

    <description>Data binding is exactly what the name implies, joining data from an existing or created table to 
        a given UX component. Data can also be bound to a control as, for example, when detail view containing textbox 
        controls is bound to list control that is in turn bound to a SQL table on a server. You can visit the main 
        [Data Binding] page for more information and guides on how to implement data binding. The properties in this section 
        are for UX components that have been data-bound.

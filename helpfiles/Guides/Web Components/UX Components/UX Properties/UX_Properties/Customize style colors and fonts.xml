<description>Customize the style colors and fonts. This provides a simpler way to customize colors than 
    editing the style. IMPORTANT: Changes you make here will apply to ALL components in this project that use 
    this style.

        <description>The 'Customize style colors and fonts' property presents an 
            alternative to using the [Style Builder] in order to create individual customized styles. 
            One of the advantages of using this property is that, unlike the Style Builder,
             you will not have manually update any CSS classes that are added to Alpha Anywhere after your style 
            is created. Because the styles defined in the Style Builder, whether local or global, are all built off 
            of a copy of a 'System' style (ex. iOS7, MobBlue, Alpha, etc...), once that copy is made, any CSS 
            class updates that occur to the original 'System' style will not appear in the copied version. One of 
            the potential downsides of the 'Customize style colors and fonts' property is that changes made to it will 
            be applied to all of the components in a project that use that style.

        <description>This property works with 'version 3' (e.g. iOS7, AndroidDark, AndroidLight) and 'version 4' 
            (e.g. Alpha) styles, both of which use SASS variables to define the colors and fonts used in the stylesheet.
            
            For a explanation of this property watch this video, '[Adjusting Colors and Fonts in a Stylesheet]', or 
            follow the guide below.

             simply type the name of the font you want to use next to the 'Family' textbox.</description>

Adjusting Colors and Fonts in a Stylesheet
To edit colors and fonts, click the smart field for the Customize style colors and fonts property.

    When you edit the colors and fonts using this builder, you are not editing the base style sheet. Instead you are storing your adjustments to the style in a separate file. This means that if the style sheet is changed by Alpha, you will get all of the edits applied to the style by Alpha, and you will still get your color and font changes.

To see the file in which your edits are stored click the Manage files hyperlink at the bottom of the dialog.

When you customize the colors and fonts for a style, the edits apply to all components in your project that use the style. So, even though you might be in UXComponent1 when you edit the colors, UXComponent2 (for example), if it uses the same style as UXComponent1, will get the same edits to the colors and fonts.

If you want to delete the custom colors you have defined, open the editor, and click the Manage files hyperlink and then delete the styleTweaks.json file that contains the settings.

    <topic>Resolve abstract CSS class names</topic>
<description>Replace abstract CSS class names with physical CSS class names. This should only be un-checked if 
    you are in development mode and you want to determine what abstract CSS class name is for a particular element 
    in the component.

        <description>CSS classes are tied to the html elements in a component that are displayed when that component is running. 
            Alpha Anywhere contains both 'abstract' and 'physical' CSS classes. The abstract classes essentially 
            act as placeholders for the physical classes. When you define a style for a component, using the [Style name] property, 
            Alpha Anywhere automatically maps a series of physical CSS classes for that style (iOS7, Alpha, MobBlue, ect..)
            on to an existing series of abstract CSS classes. These physical classes then give all of the controls in that component 
            the selected style.</description>

        <description>By default, abstract CSS classes are rarely displayed. You can, however, force Alpha Anywhere to display these 
            abstract CSS classes by unchecking the 'Resolve abstract CSS class names' checkox on the UX Properties page in the UX Properties section. 
            You can then run the component and see the abstract classes displayed in the browser.

        <description>There are quite a few abstract CSS classes used in Alpha Anywhere. One of the main benefits 
            of being able to display abstract classes is that it allows you quickly determine which class is being used in a specific 
            element. Using a browser's inspect html window you can click on various elements in a component and see which class 
            is being applied to that html. The abstract class definitions will be enclosed in square brackets.</description>

        <description>Using this information, you can then go to the [Class map] property and assign the abstract class to a new 
            physical class that you can then go and define in the [CSS definitions] property, in the CSS/SVG section of the UX Properties 
            page.s

        <description>The UX component supports two layout modes:</description>
        <list  bullet="true">
            <item>
                <name>Control Width</name>
            </item>
            <item>
                <name>Container width (recommended because the precise layout of the UX Component is much easier.</name>
            </item>
            
        </list>

        <title>Container Width</title>
        <description>In this mode, the width dimension that you specify for a control is actually 
            applied to the container 'div' that contains the control. If the control label position 
            is set to the Left or Right of the control, the actual width of the control is reduced 
            by the width of the label (because the width property is applied to the container, and not the actual 
            control).

        <description>When using Container Width mode it is easy to make the total width of all controls on a single 
            line to exactly match the total width of the controls 
            on other lines. This makes it very easy to right align controls on multiple lines. 
            You can easily lay out your dialog using percentage widths for controls.

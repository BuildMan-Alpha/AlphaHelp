    <description>The term responsive layout is commonly used to describe a layout that changes automatically depending 
        on the screen size or screen orientation of the device that you are running on. For example, if you have a mobile 
        device that has a relatively small rectangular screen, you might want the layout of the controls on that screen to change when 
        then device goes from being held vertically to being held horizontally.

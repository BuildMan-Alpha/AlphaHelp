    <topic>Responsive rules mode</topic>
    <description>This dropdown list contains two options 'First True' and 'All True'. With the First True option 
        the rules are evaluated until the first rule is found and then that rule and only that rule is applied. 
        With the 'All True' option, all of the rules that are true are applied, not just the first one. In this case the 
        'active' rule becomes the last rule that was applied.

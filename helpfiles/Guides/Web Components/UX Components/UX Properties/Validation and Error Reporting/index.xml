        <description>On many applications there is a need to prevent users from submitting 
        certain types of data, conflicting data, or wrong data into a field. For example, 
        when signing up for a service online it is often necessary to provide a user login.  
        In the case that a login name is already in use, anyone trying to register that 
        same login name will usually get an error message. This is validation and error reporting 
        and it can be carried out on either the client-side or the server-side. </description>

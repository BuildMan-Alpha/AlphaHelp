    <description>Specify when Alpha Anywhere should calculate the pre-rendered UX Component.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The UX Component can be pre-rendered before publushing. By default, the calculation is performed every time the UX Component is saved. In a large component, computing the pre-rendered component can be slow, so you may not want to compute the pre-rendered component every time your save the component.</p>
        <p>If you do not want to compute the pre-rendered component on every save, you can change the behavior to *[ui:Promt when component is saved]*. The behavior options for *[ui:When to compute pre-rendered component]* are listed below:</p>

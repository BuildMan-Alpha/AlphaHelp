    <topic>A5CWLayout class padding</topic>
    <description>Every control is wrapped in a div tag with the class 'A5CWLayout'. 
        The padding specified here is the space between adjacent controls. 
        Use CSS syntax to specify padding. e.g. 10px, .1in, etc. The default is 4px

        <description>The choice selected for the '[Layout type]' property combined with the A5CWLayout class padding setting,  
            specified here, will impact the overall organization of controls when a component is run. Using the 'Container Width' 
            setting for the Layout type is recommended. This means that when you set the width of the control on the UX Controls page, 
            you are actually setting the width of the div that contains the control.
            For example, Here is a textbox control with a width of 100%. The Layout type set to 'Container Width' and the 'A5CWLayout class padding' 
            has been set to 50px.</description>

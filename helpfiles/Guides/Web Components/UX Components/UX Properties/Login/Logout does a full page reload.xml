 <description>When the user logs out, do you want this UX component to reload? 
If you check this option, the component's layout is re-computed on the server (and controls on the UX for which membership in security groups are required are hidden).

<description>Here is why this is an important property to understand:
Assume that when you design the UX component you set the security property on certain controls in the component so that they are only visible to users who are in a certain group (i.e. security role). 
For example, you might have a button called 'Increase Salary' and you might have set the security on this button to only show the button for users who are in the 'Manager' group.
Assume that the current user is logged in as a member of the 'Manager' group - so she sees this button.
After this user logs out, you will want to ensure that this button is no longer visible. So, forcing the component to reload will cause the server to re-compute the layout of the UX component, and the button will be removed when the server sends back a re-rendered version of the component - because the user will no longer be logged in as a member of the 'Manager' group.

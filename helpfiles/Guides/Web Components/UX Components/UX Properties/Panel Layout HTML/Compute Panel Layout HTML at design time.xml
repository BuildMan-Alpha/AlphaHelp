    <topic>Compute Panel Layout HTML at design time</topic>
    <description>Applies only if the UX Component uses Panels. Specify if the Panel Layout HTML should 
        be computed at design-time, rather than at run time. For a UX Component with a large number of controls, 
        this can mean a significant saving in the time taken to render the component initially. It will, however, 
        take longer to save the component when designing it. If the component uses security groups, or server-side 
        show hide expressions to hide certain controls, then the UX component will need to be recomputed at run-time, 
        regardless of this setting.

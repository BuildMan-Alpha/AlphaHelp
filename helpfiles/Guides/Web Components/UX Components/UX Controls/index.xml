    <description>The UX component contains a large number of different types of controls. Each of these controls comes 
        with its own advantages as well as its own set of properties. Some of these properties are shared across controls 
        while others are specific to a given control type. This page contains links to the different groups of controls available in Alpha Anywhere 
        as well as a link the Control Properties pages. If you are looking for guides on how to assemble working controls, populate controls with data,
        or do any number of involved projects, look in one of the control group folders (Data Controls, Panels, Containers, Other Controls, or Defined Controls). If you want to see what a given property in a control's Properties list 
        does, and how to use it, open the Control Properties section of this page.

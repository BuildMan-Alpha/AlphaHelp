       <description><![CDATA[You can create apps that are designed to be used in multiple languages and around the world. 
        The way this is done throughout Alpha Anywhere has been to use a special <a5:r></a5:r> or <a5:t></a5:t> tag 
        around the label or text that you want to internationalize. The alternate spellings for each of the controls that 
        are tagged can then be defined in the 'Language definition' property on UX Properties page. 
        The Internationalization Helper Utilities option on the Additional Options Menu allows for multiple parts of an 
        application to be tagged in one go. 
        For a explanation on how to use the Internationalization Helper Utilities [watch this video] or read on. ]]></description>

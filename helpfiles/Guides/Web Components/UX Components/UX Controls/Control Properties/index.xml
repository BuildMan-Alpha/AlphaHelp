    <topic>Control Properties</topic>
    <description>When you add a control to a UX component on the control page, that control comes with a number of general property settings.
        These will appear in the properties list on the right side of the screen. Some controls, like the list control, come with additional builders.
        The control properties are different from the general UX properties, that are defined on the UX Properties page.

    <description>Repeating sections allow you to create a component that looks a lot like an invoice 
        with a relatively small amount of effort. The [Form View] control can also be used to create 
        master detail forms.

    <description>Repeating sections can be created by wrapping data controls inside a [RepeatingSection] container. 
       In addition to the properties pages shown here, the [RepeatingSection] page also contains guides on building features into repeating sections.

    <description>The 'Control properties' property loads different settings depending on the 
        type of Custom Control that is being edited. The [CustomControl], [StepIndicator], 
        [StarRating], [AudioPlayer], [AudioRecorderAndPlayer], [IntegerValue], [VideoPlayer], 
        and [VideoRecorderPlayer] controls all make use of the 'Control properties' property.

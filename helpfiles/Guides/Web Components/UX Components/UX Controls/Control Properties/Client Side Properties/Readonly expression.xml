    <description>If the expression is true, the control will be readonly.</description>
    <discussion>If the control has a 'picker' (e.g. a date/time picker, edit combo, Grid lookup, etc.), the control that opens the picker is *[NOT]* disabled and the user will still be able to open the picker and make a selection to change the control. Setting the control to readonly merely prevents the user from typing a value directly into the control. If you want to disable the picker, set the 'Enable expression' property instead.</discussion>

    <topic>Javascript - (Touch, Mouse, Pointer Events)</topic>
    <description>The "Javascript - (Touch, Mouse, Pointer Events)" section contains a number of event hooks for controls 
        in the UX. Your own javascript can be added to these events and will then run whenever the given event fires. These 
        events are designed for use with mobile devices.

         <description>The "Javascript - (Touch, Mouse, Pointer Events)" section is similar to the "Javascript" events, 
        only that the events here have been abstracted for use with mobile devices. Events in the "Javascript" section, like the 'onClick' event, 
        were designed to be used in correlation with a mouse or a keyboard. When run on a mobile phone, however, the 'onClick' event 
        usually has a 300ms delay that occurs after a user clicks on their device and before the specified javascript is run. 
        This delay can make the interface of a taylored mobile application cumbersome to use. Therefore this new list of 'abstract' events was created. 
        The abstracted 'click' event will always fire on the 'up'; exactly when the user either lifts their finger off a touchscreen.</description>

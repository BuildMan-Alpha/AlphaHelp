    <description>Specify the Javascript for this event. The click event fires when the user 
        taps on an element, with either the mouse, a finger, or a pointer.

        <note>If, by the time the release takes place, the mouse, finger, or pointer has moved by more 
            than the threshold amount (default is 10px), then the event is not fired. 
        </note>
        <description>Contrast the tap event with the click event. If a user moves while holding down on the element by more than the threshold the click event will still fire, 
            as long as the user is still on the original element, but the tap event will not fire. Some elements 
            do not have this event.</description>

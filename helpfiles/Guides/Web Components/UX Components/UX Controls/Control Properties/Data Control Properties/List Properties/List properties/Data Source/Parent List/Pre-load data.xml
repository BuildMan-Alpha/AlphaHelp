    <topic>Pre-load data</topic>
    <description>This property appears when the SQL Data Source Type is choosen. It specifies if the data for this List should be pre-loaded when the data for this List's parent List is loaded.
        This option is typically used when you are loading data so that the UX can be used while disconnected.
        If the child List data are pre-fetched, then no Ajax callback is necessary to populate a child List when the 
        selected row in the parent List is changed.

 <description> By default when you edit a List that is based on one or more SQL tables, 
   the database schema information is refreshed every time you click OK to exit the List builder. 
   In most cases, if your database is local, the time taken to refresh the database schema is negligible. 
   However, if your List is based on one or more tables in a remote SQL database, 
   the time taken to refresh the schema can be significant. </description>

      <description>The Refresh Database Schema property automatically refreshes a database schema on edit. This allows you to turn off the automatic refresh of schema information when the List builder is opened. If you subsequently change the structure of any of the tables that the List is based on you should click the 'Refresh Database Schema' link shown below.

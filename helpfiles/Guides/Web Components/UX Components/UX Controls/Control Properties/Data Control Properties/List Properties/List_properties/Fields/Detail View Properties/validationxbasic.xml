    <description>Specify the server-side code (Xbasic) to validate this field value before data are committed to the database.</description>
    <note>Validation Xbasic can also be defined on the Detail View control that is bound to this field. However, if the List uses a FormView control (rather than individual Detail View controls), then you will have to use this property to define server-side validation code.</note>

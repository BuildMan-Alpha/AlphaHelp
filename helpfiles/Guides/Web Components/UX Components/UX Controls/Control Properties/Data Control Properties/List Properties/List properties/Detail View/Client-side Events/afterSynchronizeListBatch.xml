<description>If the List is being synchronized in batches, fires when a batch is completed. If the function returns false, the next batch (if any) will not be sent. The data in the e object that is passed in will allow you to create your own progress counter. The countObject parameter in the e object has statistics on the current batch (e.g. number of records with errors, etc.) To see all of the properties in e.countObject you can add this to your code: alert(JSON.stringify(e.countObject)).</description>

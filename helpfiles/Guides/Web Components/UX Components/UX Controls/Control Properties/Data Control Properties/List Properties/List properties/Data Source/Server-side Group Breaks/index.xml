    <description>Server-side Group Breaks can be used with different data source types. Group breaks take the form of headers over blocks of data that share something in common.
These should not to be confused with titles. Whereas a title is inserted above a block of data, group breaks draw their definition from the data itself. Alpha Anywhere 
contains a number of properties that help in determining how the group break should be formed from existing data, whether or not it should be used to sort data, and means of changing
 group break headers. These properties are listed here.

    <topic>Convert Data Source to SQL Database</topic>
    <description>The Convert Data Source to SQL Database is very useful for converting static data into an SQL table or database.
        You can, for example, create some static data using JSON and then convert that data into an SQL table that can be stored 
        in the Northwind database, or another SQL database. This data will then be able to be accessed thru multiple browsers at the same time. 
        This is great for testing an application that will be used by multiple users at once; particularly because you do not have 
        to deal with the many error messages that are embedded in Microsoft's built in Northwind tables.
        Clicking the [...] button next to the "Convert List data source to SQL database" will open the 
        Convert Data Source Type genie.

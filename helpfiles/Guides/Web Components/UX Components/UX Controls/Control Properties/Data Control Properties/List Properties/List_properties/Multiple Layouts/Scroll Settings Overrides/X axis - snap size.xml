    <description>Specify the 'step' amount, the discrete amount by which the List is scrolled. You can 
        specify a value in pixels, or a percentage (e.g. 100%). When you specify a percentage, the percentage 
        is of the 'viewport' size. For example, if the 'viewport' in which the List is displayed is 300 px wide, then 
        setting the snap size to 100% is the same as setting it to 300px.

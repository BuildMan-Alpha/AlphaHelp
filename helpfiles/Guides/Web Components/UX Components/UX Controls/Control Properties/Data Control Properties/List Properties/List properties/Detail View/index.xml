    <description>A Detail View allows you to take the row of a given field displayed in a list control and show information from other fields related to that row. 
        For example, say you had a list of customers displayed a simple list control. Every time you highlighted a given customer in that list, the detail view 
        would display that customers specific data (address, phone number, country, etc..).

        <description>Creating a Detail View in the List Builder is a fairly simple task. For a video walkthrough using static data watch [this video]. For SQL based 
            list controls you can also watch [this second video]. Below is simple list control that has a detail view placed inside a container; in order to achieve the 
            background and border styling. In actuallity, each of the boxes displaying information in the detail view are represented by controls as well.

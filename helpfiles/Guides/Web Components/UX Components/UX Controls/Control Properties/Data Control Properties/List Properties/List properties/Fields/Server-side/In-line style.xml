      <description>If you define a server-side in-line or conditional style for a field in a List control, then the server-side style is computed on the server and is included in a separate (hidden) field in the List data. The style is then applied on the client-side. The net result of this change is that when you read data from a field that has a server-side style, the data will not include any HTML markup.

    <note>This option is not available if this List is the parent of a child List and it pre-fetches the data for the child List. Instead define a client-side style.</note>

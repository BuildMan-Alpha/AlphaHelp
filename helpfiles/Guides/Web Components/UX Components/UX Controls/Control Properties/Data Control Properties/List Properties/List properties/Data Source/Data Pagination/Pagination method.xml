    <description>Specify if pagination will be done using buttons for First, Previous, Next, and Last, a 'Fetch More' button willl appear in 
        the List Data Footer, or 'AutoFetchMore' which is similar to 'Fetch More' except that no 'Fetch More' button is displayed. 
        Instead, more records are automatically fetched as you scroll toward the end of the records that are currently loaded into the List.

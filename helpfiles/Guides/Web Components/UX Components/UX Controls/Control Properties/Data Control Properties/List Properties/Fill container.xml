    <topic>Fill container</topic>
    <description>(Applies only when control is inside a Panel Card container). Should the control expand 
        to the size of its container? (The container can either be the PanelCard, or a 'Container' control 
        with a sub-type of 'None'). TIP: If using a 'Container' control be sure to set the Container's height and width property.

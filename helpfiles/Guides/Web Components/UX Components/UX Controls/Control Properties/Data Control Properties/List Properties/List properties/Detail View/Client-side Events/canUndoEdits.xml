        <description>When you create a List Control Detail View you can add a number of pre-defined buttons to the UX component 
            that will automatically work with the Detail View and also Synchronize the Detail View with the List Control. 
            The 'Undo', aka 'Reset', button is one of these defined controls.

        <description>To add an Undo button, click on the "List-Detail View-Buttons" option in the Defined Controls 
            section of the UX Controls page. Highlight the list that the Detail View buttons apply to, and check the 
            "Undo edits to Detail View (before edits are saved)" option.

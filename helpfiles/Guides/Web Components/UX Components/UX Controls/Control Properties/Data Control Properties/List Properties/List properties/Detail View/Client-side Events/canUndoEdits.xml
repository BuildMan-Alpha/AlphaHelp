        <description>When you create a List Control Detail View you can add a number of pre-defined buttons to the UX component 
            that will automatically work with the Detail View and also Synchronize the Detail View with the List Control. 
            The 'Undo', aka 'Reset', button is one of these defined controls.

        <description>Adding a canUndoEdits event definition lets you add some javascript action 
            before the user chooses to cancel the undo. By default, the built in dialog below 
            will appear in the application after the Undo button is pressed. The canUndoEdits event fires before 
            this dialog appears. For example, if a simple alert such as alert("Warning"); is defined for 
            the canUndoEdits Event, then in Live Preview this alert will fire first and then be followed by this:

         <note>This warning is defined in the Customization section of the List Builder's Detail View pane in the 
             "Warning - confirm Detail View form reset" setting.

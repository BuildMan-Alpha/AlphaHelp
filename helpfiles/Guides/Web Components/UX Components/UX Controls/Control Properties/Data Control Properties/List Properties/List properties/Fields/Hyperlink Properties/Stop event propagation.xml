    <topic>Stop event propagation</topic>
    <description>This property opens when the specified 'Action type' is Javascript. 'Stop event propagation' specifies 
        if the events for the row (e.g. onSelect, onClick, etc.) should fire in addition to this event. If checked, 
        the row events do not fire. Note: The onTap event will NOT be stopped.

        <note>This is a server-side group break. Instead of defining server-side group breaks, you can also 
            define client side group breaks. One advantage of client-side group breaks is that client-side group
            breaks support multiple levels of grouping. To define client-side group breaks, go to the 'List Properties' pane.

        <description>In practice group breaks look a lot like titles. However, unlike titles, a group is defined by existing data.
            Here is an example of three group breaks based off of data from a field named 'Code'.

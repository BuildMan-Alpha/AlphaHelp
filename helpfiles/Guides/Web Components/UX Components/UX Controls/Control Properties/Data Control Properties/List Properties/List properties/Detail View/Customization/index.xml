    <description>When certain events are triggered, Alpha Anywhere provides a number of default 
        warning and error messages to go along with the event. For example, if you have a list control with 
        a detail view that has an 'Reset' button that you click after making an edit, you will get a message like the one below.
        The Customization section of the Detail View is where you can alter the CSS and text of these various
        messages to your liking.

<description>If the List is being synchronized in batches, fires after the last batch has completed. 
    A possible use case for this event is to allow you to close a window you might have opened to show the synchronization progress. 
    The countObject parameter in the e object has statistics on the current batch (e.g. number of records with errors, etc.) 
    To see all of the properties in e.countObject you can add this to your code: 
    alert(JSON.stringify(e.countObject)).</description>

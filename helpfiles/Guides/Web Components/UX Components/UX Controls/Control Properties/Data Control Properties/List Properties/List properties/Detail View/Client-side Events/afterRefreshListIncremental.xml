        <title>What is an Incremental Refresh?</title>
        <description>In some applications there are multiple users editing and entering data into one database on a server.
            As different users make changes, it is useful to be able to refresh the information displayed from that database on 
            the other user's client-side applications. If the server-side database is extremely large, and the a user's connection to the server is not always 
           strong, refreshing data on the client-side could prove extremely time consuming. One way around this problem is to use 
           an "Incremental Refresh", i.e. to send only the new or altered rows of data from the server to the client. This is accomplished 
           by sending a checksum, from each client-side application to the server, of all of the rows that are currently in the list control. The server 
           then uses the checksum to determine which rows have been edited on the server. These are the rows that are then sent back to the client in the response.

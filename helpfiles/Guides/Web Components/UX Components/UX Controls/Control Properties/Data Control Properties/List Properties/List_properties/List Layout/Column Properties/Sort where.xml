    <description>Specify where the data should be sorted. With the 'ClientSide' option the data is sorted 
        in the browser (using Javascript). Only the data that has already been loaded into the List is sorted - 
        so if your List is paginated, you might not get the results you are expecting. With the 'ServerSide' option an Ajax 
        callback is made to sort the data on the server. If you choose the 'Javascript' option you can specify your own 
        Javascript code to execute when the user taps on a column heading.

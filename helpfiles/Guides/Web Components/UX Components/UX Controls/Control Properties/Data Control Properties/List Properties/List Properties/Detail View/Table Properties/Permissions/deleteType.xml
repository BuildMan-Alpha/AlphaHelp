    <description>Defines the type of delete: 'Hard'' or 'Soft'.</description>
    <discussion>The delete type can be one of two options: 'Hard' or 'Soft'. A 'Hard' delete physically removes the record from the table. A 'Soft' delete updates the *[ui:Delete field]*. The *[ui:Delete field]* is set to 1 (from 0) to indicate that the record has been deleted. Records with a value of 1 in the *[ui:Delete field]* are automatically filtered from the List.</discussion>

    <description>Define custom CSS Classes that are stored at the control level.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>By default, custom CSS classes are defined at the Component level. When controls are copied between components, CSS classes used by the control defined at the Component level are not copied.</p>
        <p>*[ui:Local CSS]* allows you to define CSS classes at the Control level, allowing you to create a 'self-contained' List control that, when copied, includes any custom CSS classes that the List control uses.</p>

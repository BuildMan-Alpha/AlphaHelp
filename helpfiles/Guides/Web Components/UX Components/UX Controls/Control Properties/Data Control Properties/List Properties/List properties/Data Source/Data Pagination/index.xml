    <topic>Data Pagination</topic>
    <description>Data pagination means breaking data up into pages. 
        The properties here specify how users move through and view large blocks of data. For example, 
        when viewing a data set with 100 rows or more of data, a user might only be able to view a given number of rows at a time. 
        In this section you can choose how big the page should be, what controls should be used to navigate the pages, what these controls 
        should look like, a what they should say.

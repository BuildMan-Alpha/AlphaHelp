    <description>The data for this List will be read from the data in the current row of the parent List.
        You need to specify the name of the object in the parent List's data object that contains the data for this row.
IMPORTANT: If this List is based on a SQL query and has a 'Detail View' that is updateable, the object name MUST start with _LIST_
(e.g. _LIST_Orders)

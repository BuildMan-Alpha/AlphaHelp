        <description>For a walkthrough of the Switch control see [this video]. Alpha Anywhere also allows you to define both two state switch controls as well as 
        multi-state control. However, this is done in the Form View Builder. See ["Building a Multi-State Switch Control"] and ["Building a Two-State Switch Control"] for more detail.

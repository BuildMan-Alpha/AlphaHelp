    <description>If the value in the field is not in the list of choices for the CheckBox the "Not in list rule" property will
       determine if the current value of the field should be added to the list of choices in the checkbox. This property does not apply when the control 
       value is set by Javascript, for example using the SetValue() or .populate() methods.

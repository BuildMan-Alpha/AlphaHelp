    <description>The "Ruled style" property sets the style of the rules and 
        appears when the "Line type" property is set to 'ruled'. Using 'normal' will render the rules and margin 
        lines whether editing or viewing. The 'minimal' setting will render just the rules when viewing. The 
        'editing' option will not render lines when viewing.</description>

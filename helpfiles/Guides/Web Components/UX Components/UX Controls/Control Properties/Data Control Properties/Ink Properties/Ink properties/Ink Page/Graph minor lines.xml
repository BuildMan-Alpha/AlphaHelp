           <description>Setting the Graph minor lines to a number will result in this number of lines being applied to the x-axis and y axis in each cell.
               If this property is set to '4', for example, there will be 4 lines along the x axis of each cell and 4 lines along the y axis in each cell. 
               This will result in 16 minor cells for each major cell.

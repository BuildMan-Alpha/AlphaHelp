    <description>The Ink View properties apply to the Ink Control's View portion. When a portion of an image is altered in the 
        editor then the impact of the edit on the image as a whole is visible in the view. A zoom box inside the view can be dragged around and 
        scaled inside in order to edit different portions of an image in greater detail.

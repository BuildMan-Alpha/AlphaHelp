    <description>The preview size for the Ink (maximum width or height, in pixels) when it is being panned 
        or scaled. You should keep this value low (around 512) for mobile devices with less power.

        <description>The preview size property basically allows you to set the resolution of the image that appears on the 
            editor when you are dragging the zoom box around the view part of the Ink Control. If you set the Preview Size to a very
            low value then this transitional image in the editor will appear very blurry. When you stop dragging the zoom box in the 
            view the image shown in the editor will come back into focus.

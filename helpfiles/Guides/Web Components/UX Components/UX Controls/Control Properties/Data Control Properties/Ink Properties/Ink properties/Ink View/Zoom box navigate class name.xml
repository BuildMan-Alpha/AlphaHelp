    <description>The CSS class of the Ink Control view part zoom box (the area currently being edited) for when the view is being panned 
        or zoomed, and is in "preview mode", the view will be scaled, so CSS styling on the zoom box might look different. The 
        class can allow for a better look while navigation is happening.

         <description>Like the onSlide event property, the onChange event also eliminates the need for defining an event handler inside of an Javascript function. 
             This makes the slider more consistent with how event handlers for other controls (e.g. Switch, ButtonList, List, etc) 
               are defined, as the code for the event handlers can be added directly to the property.
            
                For backwards compatibility, you can still use the following Javascript for the event handler: </description>
         <example><![CDATA[myChangeFunction]]></example>

         <description>This is assumed to be the name of the function that you want to call.</description>

         <description>The onSlide event eliminates the need for defining an event handler inside of an Javascript function. 
             It also makes the slider more consistent with how event handlers for other controls (e.g. Switch, ButtonList, List, etc) 
               are defined, since the code for the event handlers can be added directly to the property
            
                For backwards compatibility, an older method is still supported that uses the following Javascript for the event handler: </description>

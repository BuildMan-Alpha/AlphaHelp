    <topic>Allow NULL selection</topic>
    <description>This property specifies if the Button List allows all controls to be de-selected after an initial
        selection is made.

        <description>The "auto" setting means that the ButtonList behaves like a RadioButton control (if the Allow multiple selection property is turned off)
            or like a Checkbox Control (if the Allow multiple selection property is turned on). A Radio Button control does not allow 
            a user to 'deselect' all radio buttons once a selection has been made. On the other hand a checkbox allows you to deselect all 
            choices so that there are no checkbox controls. With the "true" setting you can always deselect everything even after
            making a selection (regardless of the setting for Allow multiple). Using the "false" setting means that you can never deslect everything after
            making an initial selection.

  <note>Setting Allow NULL selection to "false" with the "Allow multiple selection" property turned off will
      result in a ButtonList where one button is always selected.

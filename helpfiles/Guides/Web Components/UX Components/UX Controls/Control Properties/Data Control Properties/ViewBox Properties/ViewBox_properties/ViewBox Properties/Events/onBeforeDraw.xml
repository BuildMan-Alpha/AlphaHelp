         <description>Unlike onBeforePopulate, the onBeforeDraw event does not take data 
             as an argument. The onBeforeDraw event can be used with viewboxes that are 
             not connected to data. The onBeforeDraw event fires after the [onBeforePopulate] 
             event and before the [onDraw] event.

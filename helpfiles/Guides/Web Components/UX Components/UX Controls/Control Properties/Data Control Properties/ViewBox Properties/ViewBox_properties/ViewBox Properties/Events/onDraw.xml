        <description>The onDraw event takes as an argument a pointer to the element that 
            the viewbox drawn into. The onDraw event takes place after the HTML used in the 
            viewbox has been updated or inserted into the viewbox. This event can fire regardless of whether 
            or not the viewbox is connected to a data source. The onDraw event fires after the onBeforeDraw 
            event has fired and before the onPopulate event fires.

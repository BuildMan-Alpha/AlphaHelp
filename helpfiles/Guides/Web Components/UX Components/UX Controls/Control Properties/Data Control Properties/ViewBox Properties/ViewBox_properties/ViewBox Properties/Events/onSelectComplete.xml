         <description>Each item in a viewbox can have an onSelect handler. 
             If you have multiple items selected, for example three items with onSelect 
             events, then the onSelectComplete event will fire once the three onSelect 
             events are selected. The onSelectComplete event takes as an argument the 
             value of the viewbox, in the form of an array.

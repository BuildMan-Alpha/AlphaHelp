    <description>This is the default event that fires when the right mouse button is clicked over 
        an item in a viewbox. The item cannot have a local onRightClick event in its definition 
        if the default onRightClick event is to be used.

         <description>If an onRightClick event is tied to a
        specific item's definition, then this localized event will be used
        in place of the default. The default onRightClick event only fires if an item 
        does NOT contain a onRightClick event in the item definition.

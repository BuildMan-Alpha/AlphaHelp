            <description>The global events shown here fall into two categories, the first category being default events.
                 Default events are events like the [onDown] or [onClick] events. Local variations of these same events can 
                 be defined for individual items inside a viewbox control by using the settings in 
                 the '[Items]' pane's '[Javascript]' section. When no action is defined for 
                 a given local event for an item on the items pane, then the global default can be used.

            <description>The second category is comprised of events for which there is no local definition and that 
                target the viewbox control itself. These are events like [onBeforeDraw], [onDraw], and [onPopulate]. Draw events 
                fire when the viewbox is drawn and populate events fire when the viewbox is populated with data. The
                 onSelectComplete event falls into this category too. The [onSelectComplete] event is rather unique
                  in that it fires only after all of the onSelect events listed in the items pane have fired..

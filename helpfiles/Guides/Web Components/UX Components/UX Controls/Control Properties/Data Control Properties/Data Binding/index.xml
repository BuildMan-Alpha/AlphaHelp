    <description>You can use data binding to create new tables with fields that can then be used in the UX component. 
        This is done on the '[Data Binding]' page of the UX Builder. Once the data from a new or existing table has been bound 
        to the component you can use the properties in this section to bind a control to one of the fields in the databound table. 
        It is also possible to match controls to a data bound table on the Data Binding page itself.

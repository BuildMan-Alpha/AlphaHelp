    <description>Specifies the mapping between the selected address and controls in the UX Component.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The *[ui:Special type settings]* property defines how the selected address is mapped to individual controls in the UX Component. For each address part that is mapped, you can choose to use the 'long' or 'short' form of the address string. For example, when mapping the state field, the long form may be 'Massachusetts' while the short form would use the state's abbreviation, 'MA'.</p>

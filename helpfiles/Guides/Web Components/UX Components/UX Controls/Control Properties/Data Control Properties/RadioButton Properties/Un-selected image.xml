    <topic>Un-selected image</topic>
    <description>Specify the image to show on the radio button when the item is not selected. This is 
        typically a null image that has the same size as the selected image. You can leave 
        this blank to use a default image. Typically, you only need to set this image if you specify a custom 
        selected image that has a different size than the default selected image.

    <topic>Suppress labels when in AbsoluteLayout container</topic>
    <description>If this control is inside an AbsoluteLayout container, should the labels 
      for each Radiobutton control be suppressed? You might want to do this if you are 
      using a bitmap background for the AbsoluteLayout container and the bitmap has labels on it.

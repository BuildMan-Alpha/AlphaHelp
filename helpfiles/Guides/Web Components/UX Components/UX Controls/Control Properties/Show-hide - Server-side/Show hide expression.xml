    <description>Specify the show/hide expression. The show/hide 
        expression can refer to session variables or arguments defined in the 
        Properties pane. The control is shown if the expression is true. If the 
        expression is false or invalid, perhaps because a referenced session variable has not yet 
        been defined, the control is not shown.

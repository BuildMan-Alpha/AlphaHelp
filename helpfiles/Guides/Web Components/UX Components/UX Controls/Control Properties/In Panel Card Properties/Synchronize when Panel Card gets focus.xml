    <topic>Synchronize when Panel Card gets focus</topic>
    <description>When you have an embedded UX component this proerty allows you to automatically synchronize the UX every time the Panel Card gets focus (assuming that the Panel Card is contained in a Panel Navigator).
If this option is checked, the embedded UX component's server-side onSynchronize event and client-side onSynchronizeDialog events are fired.

<title>Windows, Auto-suggest and Edit-combo - Specifying a Maximum Window Height</title>

 <description>When you define the window height for a pop-up window, an auto-suggest control or an edit-combo control, you can specify a window height.

    </section>
    <section>
          <description>If you leave the height property blank, the window will be sized to accommodate the entire height of the content (which will result in a window that is too high if there is a lot of content).
On the other hand, if you specify an explicit size, then you will end up with a window that looks too big if there is just a small amount of content in the window.

          <description>To remedy this problem, you can alter the window height by using the 'max' syntax. This will automatically size the window to fit its content, but prevent it from growing bigger than the specified max size. For example, you can specify the height property as:

          <example><![CDATA[max: 300px

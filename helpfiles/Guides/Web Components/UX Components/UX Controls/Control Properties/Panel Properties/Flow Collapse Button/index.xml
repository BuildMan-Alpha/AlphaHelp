    <description>Flow Collapse buttons allow you to collapse a panel in a Layout flow. In some ways 
        this functions a lot like a row expander, although with Panels rather then rows. This can be useful 
        if there is a general work area in an application that can be made bigger by closing Panels placed before it 
        in the Layout flow. As there are multiple Layout flow directions that can be defined, there are also multiple ways 
        in which Panels can be designed to collapse. The design of the flow collapse button can be defined 
        in this section.

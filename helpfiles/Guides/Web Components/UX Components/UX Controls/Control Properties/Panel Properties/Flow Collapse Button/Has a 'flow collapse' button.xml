    <topic>Has a 'flow collapse' button</topic>
    <description>Specify if this Panel has a button that collapses or expands (i.e. 'docks' or 'hides')
         all Panels that are 'before' this Panel in the parent PanelLayout. The meaning of 'before' 
         depends on the parent PanelLayout's 'flow direction'. For example, if the flow direction is LTR, then 
         'before' means Panels to the left of this Panel. Note that you only need to specify a single button which acts 
         as a toggle, either collapsing or expanding Panels.

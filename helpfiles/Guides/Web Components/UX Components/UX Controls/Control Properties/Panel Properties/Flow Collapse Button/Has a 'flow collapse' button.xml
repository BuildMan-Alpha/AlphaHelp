    <topic>Has a 'flow collapse' button</topic>
    <description>Specify if this Panel has a button that collapses or expands (i.e. 'docks' or 'hides')
         all Panels that are 'before' this Panel in the parent PanelLayout. The meaning of 'before' 
         depends on the parent PanelLayout's 'flow direction'. For example, if the flow direction is LTR, then 
         'before' means Panels to the left of this Panel. Note that you only need to specify a single button which acts 
         as a toggle, either collapsing or expanding Panels.

           <description>For a video explanation of 'flow collapse' buttons watch [this video]. Below 
               is an example of two expanded 'flow collapse' buttons, one in Panel 2 and one in Panel 3. By default each button is 
               denoted by two blue angle brackets <![CDATA['<<']]> but could be any HTML or icon. In this case Panel 1 does not require a flow collapse button. Because it is the first 
               Panel in the flow, collapsing Panel 2 will hide Panel 1.

            <description>When a 'flow collapse' button is clicked on, the panel before it in the 'flow' is hidden or docked. Here 
                Panel 2's 'flow collapse' button has been clicked.

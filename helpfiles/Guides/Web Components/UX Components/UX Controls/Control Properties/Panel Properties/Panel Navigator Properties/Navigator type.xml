    <description>Specify the method for navigating between the Panels contained in this PanelNavigator. 
        Choose 'Programmatic' if you want to use Javascript methods to navigate between Panels. 
        'Tab Band' is typically only used in was Panel in the Navigator in the Navigator Header or Footer. 
        'List' displays a list of choices (and possibly sub-choices if a cascading list is defined). Clicking on an item in the list 
        shows a Panel. 'OrientationChange' allows you to specify a Panel that gets focus for landscape 
        and another Panel that gets focus for portrait.

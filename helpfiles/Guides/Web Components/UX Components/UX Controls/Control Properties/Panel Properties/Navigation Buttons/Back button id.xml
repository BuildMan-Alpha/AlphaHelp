         <description>The 'Back' button moves to the last Panel to be viewed, which might not be the previous panel. For example, 
             say there are three panels and you click next on panel 1, next on panel 2, and the previous on panel 3. If you were to then 
             click the 'Back' button on Panel 2, you would return to Panel 3 as shown below:

        <description>This is in contrast to the "Previous" button which moves to the previous panel in the Panel Navigator's flow. If you were 
            to click on Panel 2's 'Previous card' button in the situation above, then this would bring you back to Panel 1.

    <topic>Has 'Back' button</topic>
    <description>Specify if the Navigator has a 'Back' button that moves to the 
        previously viewed Panel. This is different than the 'Previous' Panel, which 
        relies on the Panel order. Typically used when the Panel Navigator uses the 
        'List' navigation method.

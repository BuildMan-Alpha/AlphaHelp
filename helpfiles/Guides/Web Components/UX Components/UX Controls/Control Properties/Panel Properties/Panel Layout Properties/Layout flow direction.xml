        <description>Below is a very simple Panel Layout container containing two Panel Cards, each containing a [Static Text] control. 
            The background styling of each Panel Card has also been altered to make them more visible.

        <description>The Panel Layout can itself contain additional Panel Layout containers that might have different Layout flow directions from their 
            parent. Panel Navigators contained in a Panel Layout should follow the same Layout flow direction that Panel Cards do, in terms of the Panel Navigators placement.

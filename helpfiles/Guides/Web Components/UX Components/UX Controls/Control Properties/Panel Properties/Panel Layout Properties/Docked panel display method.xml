    <topic>Docked panel display method</topic>
    <description>Specify how docked panels should be displayed when they are invoked. 'Over' displays 
        the Panel on top of the existing Panel Layout. 'Slide' will shift the existing Panels to the right 
        so that there is room to show the Panel being shown. 'Push' will push the existing Panels to the left, right, 
        top or bottom, depending on the flow direction.

    <description>Specify how docked panels should be displayed when they are invoked. 'Over' displays 
        the Panel on top of the existing Panel Layout. 'Slide' will shift the existing Panels to the right 
        so that there is room to show the Panel being shown. 'Push' will push the existing Panels to the left, right, 
        top or bottom, depending on the flow direction.

        <description>To demonstrated take the following panel configuration designed based the guide on the [Docked Panel controller buttons] page. 
            This panel has a button on it that when clicked will open a 150px wide docked/hidden panel.

        <description>Selecting the 'Over' option for the 'Docked panel display method' will cause the docked panel to move over the existing main panel. 
            In this scenario part of the main panel's text and button will be obscured by the docked panel.

        <description>Selecting the 'Slide' method will make the 'main' panel appear to slide toward whatever direction the 
            '[Layout flow direction]' property is set to. As it does so it will reveal the docked panel underneath it.

        <description>The end result of Push is similar to slide. However, with the 'Push' selection the docked panel appears 
            to actively push the main panel off the screen, at least on a mobile device.

    <topic>Panel Layout Properties</topic>
    <description>Panel Layouts are containers that can contain Panels, Panel Navigators, and even other Panel Layout containers. 
        The Panel Layout Properties section allows you to define how the sub-containers inside a panel layout will act. 
        For example, the direction that the containers will flow in, what method of animation will be used to display 
        panels, what buttons reveal hidden panels, and more.

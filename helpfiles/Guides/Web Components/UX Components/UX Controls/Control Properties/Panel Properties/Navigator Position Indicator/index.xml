    <description>If you have a multiple panels inside a Panel Navigator, you can use a 'Navigation Position Indicator' 
        as an easy way for users to see which panel they are on. By default the indicator is a series of grey dots, one dot 
        for each panel, that shows up at the bottom of the user's screen. The currently active panel is denoted by a blue dot.

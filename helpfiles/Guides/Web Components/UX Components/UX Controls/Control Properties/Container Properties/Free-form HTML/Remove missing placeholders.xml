    <topic>Remove missing placeholders</topic>
    <description>The free-form layout uses placeholders for controls in the dialog. 
        If a placeholder for a control has not been defined, or if the control was 
        removed because of a server side show/hide expression, or security setting, the placeholder 
        in the template will not get replaced. If you check this box, unresolved placeholders 
        will be removed.

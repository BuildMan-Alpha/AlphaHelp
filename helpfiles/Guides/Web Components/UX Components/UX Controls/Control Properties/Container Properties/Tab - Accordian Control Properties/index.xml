    <description>Creating a Tab Control gives you access to the Tab/Accordian Control properties. The Tab Control is located
        inside the 'Containers' dropdown menu on the UX Controls page. The Tab Control will also need to include a Tab Pane inside of it 
        and the Tab Pane will also need its own control underneath it.</description>

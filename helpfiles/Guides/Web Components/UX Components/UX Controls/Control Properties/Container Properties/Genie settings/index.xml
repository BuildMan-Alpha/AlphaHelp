    <description>When the 'Genie style' checkbox in the 'Tab/Accordion Control Properties' section 
        is checked, then a number of 'Genie settings' will appear. These settings structure how the 
        genie will appear when the component is run.

           <description>The genie provides an alternate customizable method of 
        moving between the tab panes in a tab control. Rather then clicking on an individual tab to open a given 
        tab pane, users can click on 'next' and 'previous' buttons to move between tabs.</description>

    <topic>Prevent container float</topic>
    <description>By default all containers are set to 'float'. This option prevents the 
        container from using the 'float' atribute in its CSS style. An example of when 
        you might want to use this option is when the container has a client-side show/hide expression 
        and the space taken by the container should be completely eliminated. When this option is checked, there will 
        always be a break both before and after the container, regardless of the setting for the 'break' 
        property in the corresponding 'Container End' item.

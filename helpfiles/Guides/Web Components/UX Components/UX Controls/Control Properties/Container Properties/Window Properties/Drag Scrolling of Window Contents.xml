    <topic>Drag Scrolling of Window Contents</topic>
    <description>If a pop-up window contains more content than can be displayed in the window, you can turn on drag scrolling of the window so that the window contents can be scrolled on touch enabled devices. You can also define 'pull past end' settings (for  example, you can define an event when the user drags up on the window contents past the end of the contents).</description>

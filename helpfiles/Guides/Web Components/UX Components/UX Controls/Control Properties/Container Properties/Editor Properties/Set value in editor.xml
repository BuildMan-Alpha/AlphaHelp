        <description>Your code can reference 'value' or the value that needs to be put into the editor. 
            If you are editing a group of fields, then 'value' is an array. You code can reference the individual 
            items in the 'value' array. E.g. value [0], value [1], etc. If the editor is bound to a FormView control, 
            your code can also reference 'settings.data', an object with values for all of the fields in the Form.

    <topic>Use CSS for responsive sizing</topic>
    <description>This option uses CSS to resize the video player. It does not rely on the 
        orientation change event and is very fast and fluid. Since the video player size 
        is driven by CSS and the aspect ratio of 16:9 is maintained, the height of the player may exceed the visible 
        container height on certain mobile devices. The container may be scrolled should this occur.

         <description>If you check this option, and if the Video Player is contained in a 'Container' control, be sure 
             to set these properties on the containing 'Container':'Alignment' = 'Left', 'Prevent container float' = 
             checked.

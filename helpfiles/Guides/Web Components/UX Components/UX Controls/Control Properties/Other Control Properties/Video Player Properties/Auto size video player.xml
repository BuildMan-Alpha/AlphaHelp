    <topic>Auto size video player</topic>
    <description>If enabled, the video player will dynamically adjust both width and height 
        to display the video at the maximum size of the parent container. An 
        aspect ratio of 16:9 will be maintained. On orientation change, the player 
        will be resized to best fit within the panel card.

<topic>Control container class name</topic>
<description>Advanced and Optional. All controls are automatically wrapped in a div (with a class name of 
	'A5CWLayout' or 'A5container'), unless the control is in a 'NoFloat' container. You can specify a class name to use for 
	the control container in addition to the 'A5CWLayout' or 'A5container' class that is automatically used. 
	This allows you to have more control over the appearance of the control.

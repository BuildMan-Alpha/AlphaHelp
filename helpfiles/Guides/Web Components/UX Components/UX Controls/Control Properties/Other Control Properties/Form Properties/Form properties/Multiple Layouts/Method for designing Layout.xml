    <topic>Method for designing Layout</topic>
    <description>This dropdown property has two options for designing a Layout: Genie and Freeform. All layouts are edited on 
        the Form Layout pane, which also has a genie/freeform radio button option for design. If you choose 'genie' option as
         the 'Method for designing Layout' on the Multiple Layouts pane, you will see the genie open for that layout on the Form Layout pane; 
         and likewise for the 'Freeform' option.

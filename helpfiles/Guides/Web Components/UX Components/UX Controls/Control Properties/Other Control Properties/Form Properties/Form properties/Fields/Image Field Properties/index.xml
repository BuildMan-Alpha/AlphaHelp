    <description>If you define a field as being an Image, in the Fields pane of the Form View Builder, the Image Field Properties 
        will appear in the properties list when that field is highlighted. In order to specify that a field is an image change the Field type 
        property from 'Unspecified'' to 'Image'. The [Field type] property is located in the Field Properties section of the Fields pane.

    <topic>Base64 prefix</topic>
    <description>If the base64 data in the field already has a prefix in the base64 encoded data (e.g. 'data:image/jpg;base64.') then 
        you will not need to add a prefix. But if the data in the field is just raw base64 encoded data, you will need to add the 
        appropriate prefix.

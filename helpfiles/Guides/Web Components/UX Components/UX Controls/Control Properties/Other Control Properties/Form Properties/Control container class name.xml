    <topic>Control container class name</topic>
    <description>Advanced/Optional. All controls are automatically wrapped in a div with a class name of 'A5CWLayout' or 
        'A5container', unless the control is in a 'NoFloat' container. You can specify a class name to use for the control 
        container in addition to the 'A5CWLayout' or 'A5container' class that is automatically used. This allows you to have 
        more control over the appearance of the control.

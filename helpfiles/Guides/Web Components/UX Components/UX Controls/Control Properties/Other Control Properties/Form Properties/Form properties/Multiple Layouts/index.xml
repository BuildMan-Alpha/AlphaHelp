    <description>Multiple Layouts give users the option to view a Form View control in different ways. What 
        the Form View' CSS looks like, what items appear on it, and how the control is structured can be easily altered when more than one layout has been defined. 
        Checking the 'Has multiple layouts' property in the Form Properties section of the Form Properties pane will 
        open the Multiple Layouts pane. New Form View layouts are created on this pane and then defined in the Form Layout pane as usual.

        <description>Unlike the List Control, the Form View has no pre-defined control for viewing different 
            form view layouts in Live Preview. It is possible, however, to see the different layouts in the Form View Builder 
            itself by first defining a layout, highlighting it, and then clicking the preview button (lightning bolt) at the 
            bottom of the Form View Builder.</description>

        <description>In order to assign multiple layouts to different devices, such that different layouts load automatically whenever the screen size 
            or orientation changes, see [Responsive Layout Settings]. These settings can be found on the UX Properties page.</description>

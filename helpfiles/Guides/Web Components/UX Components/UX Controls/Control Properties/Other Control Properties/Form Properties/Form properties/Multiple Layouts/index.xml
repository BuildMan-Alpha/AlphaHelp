    <description>Multiple Layouts give users the option to view a Form View control in different ways. What 
        the Form View' CSS looks like, what items appear on it, and how the control is structured can altered with the 
        click of a button if more than one layout has been defined. Checking the 'Has multiple layouts' property in the Form Properties section of the Form Properties pane will 
        open the Multiple Layouts pane. New layouts are created on this pane and then defined in the Form Layout pane as usual.

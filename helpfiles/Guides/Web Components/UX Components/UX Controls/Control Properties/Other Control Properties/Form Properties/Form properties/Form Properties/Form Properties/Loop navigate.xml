    <description>When navigating from one selected item to the next item using the arrow keys, should the first item 
        in the Form be selected when you navigate past the last item in the Form.

          <description>For example, here is a form view control hooked to a list control with a number of fields.
              The fields in the list control are represented as items in the form view control. 
              The items can be edited using the editor underneath the form view.

          <description>Say you were to edit the Firstname item by clicking on it. When you tap the down arrow key 
              on your keyboard the Lastname item will be brought up to edit. If 'Loop navigate is not checked, 
              this selection method will work all the way down to the last item in the list, in this case 'Status'.
              When 'Loop navigate' is checked, clicking the down arrow on the last item will make the editor load the first item 
              on the Form View.</description>

    <description>The idea of 'Items' is based off of the viewbox control. 
        Items are arbitrary html inside of something that helps delegates events. 
        Items are used in order to create 'targets' or 'hot' areas in an application; i.e. things to click on, or that can generate other events.
        This feature can help developers get around making extensive use of editors in order to delegate events.
        For example, by creating a named item labeled 'save', that saves a form by delegating an event and then firing off some javascript, you can eliminate 
        the need for making extensive use of editors with the Form View control. 
        Items support a lot more than onClick events and can even support multiple events on the same target area. 
You can create items that when tapped will load an editor for a given field, 
that when swiped one way it will go true, and that when swiped the other way will go false.

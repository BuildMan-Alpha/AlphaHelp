    <description>The Default template property helps you to create a general HTML template for a form view control.
      Before adding a template, the FormView simply appears as raw HTML. As such it is fairly uninteresting. Adding a template 
      can give a formview control the same styling that other controls have. You can also add your own general HTML styling here.

    <description>If you want to style a specific Field in the Form View you should go to the Form Layout pane, highlight the field that you want to stylize, 
      and click the '[Template property]' on the Form Properties pane of the Form View Builder.

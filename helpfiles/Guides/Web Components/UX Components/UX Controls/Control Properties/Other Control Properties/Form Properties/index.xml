    <description>Property settings that govern the Form View control. The 'Form properties'' property opens the Form View Builder. 
        Using Form View controls lets developers avoid adding extensive numbers of controls to a component; while maintaining 
        the same look and functionality as a component with lots of controls. The end result is usually a more efficient component.

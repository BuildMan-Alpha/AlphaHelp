    <topic>Method for opening UX in a PhoneGap or Static HTML application</topic>
    <description>Applies only to UX components. Normally, this component is opened 
        by making an Ajax callback to the server. In a mobile PhoneGap 
        application, or a static HTML application, the device might not have a 
        connection to the server and so making an Ajax callback is not possible. 
        In this case you can render a pre-computed version of the target UX component.

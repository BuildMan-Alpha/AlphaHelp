            <description>The list of Switch controls was created by wrapping it in a [ControlGroup Container] and modifying the style of the control and control's label. The *[ui:Width]* for every Switch control is also set to *[ui:100%]*, so it will fill the row.</description>

                <p>Notice that the *[ui:Control Container Classname]* property has been set to a custom class name (code below.)</p>
                <p>In the CSS, we first set the control container to have a relative position - which means all absolutely positioned child elements will be positioned relative to the parent - allowing parent width and position to be honored be the child. </p>
                <p> We then set the first level of child DIVs (of which there is only one - the switch itself - the label is a *[html:&lt;label&gt;]* element) to have an absolute position, a specific width, and a right location of *[css:0px]* - which means it will stick to the right of the parent.</p>

            <example code="css"><![CDATA[.switchCtrlGroup {
position: relative;
}
.switchCtrlGroup > div {
position: absolute;
right: 0px;
width: .75in;
}]]></example>

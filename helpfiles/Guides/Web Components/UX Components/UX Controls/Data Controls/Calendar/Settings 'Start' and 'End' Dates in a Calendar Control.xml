    <topic>Settings 'Start' and 'End' Dates in a Calendar Control</topic>
    <description>A common use of a calendar control, particularly on travel sites, is to have users enter a 
        'start' and 'end' date into the calendar, or an 'arrival' and 'departure' date. It is 
        desirable to be able to prevent the user from being able to enter an 'end' date that is 
        before their 'start' date or even the current date. Fortunately this is fairly easy to accomplish 
        in Alpha Anywhere.

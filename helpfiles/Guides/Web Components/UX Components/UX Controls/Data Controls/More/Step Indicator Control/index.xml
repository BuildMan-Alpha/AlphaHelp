                <p>When you add a Step Indicator control you can specify as many steps as you want and you can define the labels for each step. You can also control the color of the completed steps (blue in the above example) and the un-completed steps (gray in the above example).</p>
                <p>The Step Indicator control is a Data Control. This means that you can set its value using the [{dialog.object}.setValue()] method and you can read its value using the [{dialog.object}.getValue()] method.</p>
                <p>For example, to set the above control so that it shows you are at the beginning of the sequence (on the first step) you would use:</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[{dialog.object}.setValue('name of control',0);]]></example>

            <description>To set the control's value so that it shows you are on step Three (i.e. as shown in the above image) you would use:</description>

            <description>In the image below, the 'Dot' size has been increased, the 'Show step indicators as circles' property has been turned off and the 'Dot size' has been set to '40px'. A small border radius of 2px has been set so that the 'dot' (squares in this case) have slightly rounded edges.</description>

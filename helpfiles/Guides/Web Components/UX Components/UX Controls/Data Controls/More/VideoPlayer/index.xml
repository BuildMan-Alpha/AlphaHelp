            <description>If you have spent some time inside the UX Builder, you may have noticed that there are different places where
        you can define VideoPlayer controls. The Video Player control shown here, in the 'Data Controls' menu, can be used to add 
        a VideoPlayer control to a component that is data-bound and that will operate in a disconnected environment. 
        The term "Data-bound" means that this control gets its data, the path to a video, from a database on a server. This data is 
        loaded from the server to a client-side device, such as a mobile phone. The term 'Disconnected' refers to the fact that 
        the client-side device does not have an uninterrupted connected to the server in order to function.
        
         This particular control will only allow users to playback existing videos.
          To give users the ability to record videos use the [Video Recorder/Player] control.</description>
        Event definitions for the data bound VideoPlayer control can be set using the '[Control properties]' property.

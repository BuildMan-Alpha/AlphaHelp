    <topic>Set the Min and Max Values at Run-time for a SemiCircularNumberDisplay Control</topic>
    <description>The minimum and maximum value of the SemiCircularNumberDisplay Control can be dynamically set at run-time.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The SemiCircularNumberDisplay control can be dynamically updated at run-time to change the minimum and maximum value shown in the control. The [{dialog.object}.getControl()] method can be used to get the SemiCircularNumberDisplay control object. The object has properties and methods that can be used to manipulate the control on the client. The minimum and maximum values are stored in the SemiCircularNumberDisplay control object's *[js:rgraphSettings]* property: *[js:obj.rgraphSettings.min]* and *[js:obj.rgraphSettings.max]*. The minimum and maximum value are stored as numbers within the rgraphSettings object. </p>

    <example code="js"><![CDATA[//get a pointer to the control
var obj = {dialog.object}.getControl('semicircularNumber_1');

//set the min and max
obj.rgraphSettings.max = 200;
obj.rgraphSettings.min = 40;

//redraw the control
obj.redraw();]]></example>

    <description>TextBox controls provide an means to create new text that can be entered into other controls, such 
        as a list control. Through its 'Lookup' properties, in the control properties list, a Textbox can also be 
        used to create Edit-Combo boxes that display a list of choices that users can select from. You can also add 
        buttons to a textbox that will allow you to clear entered data, search for entries in a list, filter a list, 
        or run some customized javascript code or action.

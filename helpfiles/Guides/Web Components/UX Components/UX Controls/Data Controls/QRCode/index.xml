    <description>Quick Response Codes or QR codes are optical labels that contain data and that can be added to documents and/or websites. 
        A device equipped with imaging capabilities, like a smart-phone camera, 
        can then be used to access the information contained within these labels. 
        One advantage to using QR Codes is that they have the ability to store a large amount of information 
        about something in a very small space. Because they are machine readable, this information can be used by devices
        to side-step tasks that would take the users of an application considerable time to deal with. For example, 
        a QR Code can contain a long URL which, when photographed using a phone, will automatically take users to a website; 
        without the user typing in the URL. QR Codes are used extensively in tracking, product identification, and marketing.

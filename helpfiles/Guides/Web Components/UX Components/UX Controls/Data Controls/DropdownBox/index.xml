    <description>The drop-down box control resembles the textbox control except that it has a button 
        next to it. When a user clicks on a button, a list of choices are displayed. After user selects 
        one of the choices, the selected value is used to fill in the drop-down. The choices defined 
        for a drop-down control can be static, dynamic, or based on a variable.

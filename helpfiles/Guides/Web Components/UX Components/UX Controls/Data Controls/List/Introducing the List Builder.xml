    <description>The List Builder can be a very powerful control, particularly when used in combination with 
        a Form View control and Editors/Editor Sets.

    <description>The List Builder has a 'Preview' button to do a quick preview of the List control 
      while you are in the List builder. The Preview window is modeless, meaning you can keep it open 
      while you are working in the List builder (and move it to a second screen if your computer has two monitors). 
      This makes it very convenient to preview the List after every change you make. For a video explanation 
      watch [this video].</description>

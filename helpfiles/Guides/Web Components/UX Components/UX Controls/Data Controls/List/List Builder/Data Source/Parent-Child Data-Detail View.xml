      <description>In disconnected applications, when you define parent-child relationships between List controls you must set the child List's 'Pre-load data' property to true.
However, when you are building a connected application you might still want to define a parent-child relationship between Lists and you might want to define a Detail View for each List to allow editing of the List data, but you might not want to pre-load the child data (since Alpha Anywhere can easily fetch the child data as needed as you have a connection).

  <description>Previously, if you did not have the pre-load option checked, you were not allowed to edit data in the child Lists (using the child List's Detail View).
Now, you can edit data in the child Lists, but you must specify linking values in the optional Linking fields section. The data you fill into these properties is used to ensure that the values in the linking fields are automatically set to the corresponding values in the parent List record when insert or updates are performed.</description>

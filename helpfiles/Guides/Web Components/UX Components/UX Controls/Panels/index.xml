    <description>Panels present a convenient way for organizing mobile applications. The controls that 
        make up an application are placed inside Panel Cards. If Panel Cards are placed inside a 
        Panel Navigator, then users can move through the Panel Cards by swiping their mobile device and/or 
        pressing specified buttons. When placed in a Panel Layout, both Panel Navigator containers and Panel Cards 
        can be designed to appear on the same screen. </description>

    <description>Groups SpinList controls together, creating a single, complex 'spin list'.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>SpinList controls inside a *[ui:SpinListGroup]* container are grouped together such that they appear as a single, logical control.</p>
        <p>For example, you may have three SpinList controls, display a list of days, months, and years. If you put these three SpinList controls in a *[ui:SpinListGroup]* container, horizontal space between the controls will be removed, making the SpinList controls appear as one, single control.</p>

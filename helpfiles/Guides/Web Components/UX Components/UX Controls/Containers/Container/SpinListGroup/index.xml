    <description>Groups Spin List controls together, creating a single, complex 'spin list'.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>[Spin List] controls inside a *[ui:SpinListGroup]* container are grouped together such that they appear as a single, logical control.</p>
        <p>For example, you may have three SpinList controls, display a list of days, months, and years. If you put these three SpinList controls in a *[ui:SpinListGroup]* container, horizontal space between the controls will be removed, making the SpinList controls appear as one, single control.</p>
        <p>For example, in the screen shot shown below, the first frame container shows three Spin List controls that have been placed in a special 'SpinListGroup' container. Notice how the three controls appear to be a single control.</p>
        <p>In the second frame container, the same three Spin List controls are not inside a 'SpinListGroup' container, and therefore they appear as three independent controls.</p>

            <description>The screenshot below shows how the above UX component was designed. Notice that the Spin List controls in the first frame are contained in a 'SpinListGroup' container.</description>

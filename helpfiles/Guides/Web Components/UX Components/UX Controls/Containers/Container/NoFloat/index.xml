    <description>Controls in this container are not wrapped in a div when rendered.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>Normally, a control in a UX Component is wrapped in a *[ui:div]* element, adding horizontal and veritcal spacing to the control to prevent adjacent controls from touching each other. Controls in a UX Component also 'float' from left-to-right, until a 'break' forces controls to start on a new line.</p>
        <p>Controls placed inside a *[ui:NoFloat]* container are *[not]* wrapped in a *[ui:div]* element and do not 'float' from left-to-right. All horizontal spacing between adjacent controls is removed, and each control is displayed on its own line, regardless of the setting of the control's 'break' property.</p>

 <description>The FormView Control can be used with List Controls and Editor sets to great effect. 
     The Data Source for FormView controls are usually defined as a List control. The data gathered from the 
     List Control can then be linked to 'items' and placed inside HTML blocks that can easily be made to look 
     exactly like individual UX controls. This gives developers all of the functionality found in an application 
     with many UX controls but can also produce a UX component that is much lighter and faster. See FormView Properties 
     for a list of individual properties relating to the FormView and FormView Builder.

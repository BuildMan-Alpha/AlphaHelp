         <description>The Video Player Control supports YouTube, Vimeo, Viddler and HTML5 video players.

The player supports many options specific to the type of player used.

         <note>The 'auto play' option does not work on mobile devices as it is disabled in an effort to conserve bandwidth. 
An 'automatic sizing' option is included to adjust the video player size on device orientation change. This feature is important on Android devices.

         <description>A typical use case is to include a panel navigator with two panel cards. The first panel card contains a list control that may display the video title, the second panel card includes the video player control. When the user taps on a row in the list, the second panel card is transitioned into view and the video may be played. [Download] a sample component that demonstrates this use case.

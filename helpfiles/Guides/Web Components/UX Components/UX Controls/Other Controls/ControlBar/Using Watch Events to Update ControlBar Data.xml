<topic>Using Watch Events to Update ControlBar Data</topic>

<description>The ControlBar data can be updated automatically in response to certain events in the UX 
	(such as the UX going dirty, a List going dirty, etc.) or by a change in the value of one or more controls. 
	Watch Events can be defined in the ControlBar Builder inside the Data pane by first clicking the 'Add Data Item' button 
	and then checking the 'Update value automatically based on a 'watch' events' checkbox. If a html item is placed in the ControlBar 
	then the Watch Event can be added as a placeholder in the HTML text property.

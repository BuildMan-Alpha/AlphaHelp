<title>Layouts</title>
<description><p>A ControlBar control can have multiple 'layouts'. In this respect, a ControlBar is similar to a List control, a ViewBox control or a FormView control, all of which also can have multiple layouts.</p>
<p>You can dynamically select which of the ControlBar layouts to display. So, for example, you might use one layout for a phone in portrait mode, another layout for a phone in landscape mode, yet another layout for a tablet in portrait mode, etc. You can use Javascript to choose which ControlBar layout to set as the active layout, or you can use the Responsive Layout Settings genie to select the active layout.</p>
<p>Another example of where having a ControlBar with multiple layouts would be useful is in the case of a PanelNavigator. You could also define a ControlBar for the header section of the PanelNavigator and then dynamically change the layout that was shown depending on which PanelCard was shown in the PanelNavigator.</p></description>

<description>In order to understand how ControlBars work you need to understand the following ControlBar concepts, each of which is explained in more detail below.

<title>Layouts</title>
<description>A ControlBar control can have multiple 'layouts'. In this respect, a ControlBar is similar to a List control, a ViewBox control or a FormView control, all of which also can have multiple layouts.
You can dynamically select which of the ControlBar layouts to display. So, for example, you might use one layout for a phone in portrait mode, another layout for a phone in landscape mode, yet another layout for a tablet in portrait mode, etc. You can use Javascript to choose which ControlBar layout to set as the active layout, or you can use the Responsive Layout Settings genie to select the active layout.
Another example of where having a ControlBar with multiple layouts would be useful is in the case of a PanelNavigator. You could also define a ControlBar for the header section of the PanelNavigator and then dynamically change the layout that was shown depending on which PanelCard was shown in the PanelNavigator.</description>

<title>Layout Lines</title>

<description>Each layout that you define in a ControBar can have one or more 'lines'. In many cases a layout will only have a single line. In the first image showing a typical Panel header, only a single 'line' would be needed in the ControlBar layout.
Each 'line' in a ControlBar layout is divided into three sections. These are:<description>

<section>
<list>
<item><description>
before</description></item>
<item><description>
middle</description></item>
<item><description>
after</description></item>

</list>
</section>

The 'before' section is for left justified content, and the 'after' section is for right justified content. The reason that these sections are not called 'left', 'center' and 'right' as you might have expected is that a ControlBar can be aligned to any edge of the screen. If a ControlBar is aligned to the top or bottom of the screen, the ControlBar is horizontal and 'before' does correspond to 'left' and 'after' does correspond to 'right'. However, ControlBars can also be aligned to the left or right of the screen. In these cases, the ControlBar will be rendered vertically, and the 'before' section will then correspond to the 'top' of the ControlBar and the 'after' section will correspond to the 'bottom' of the ControlBar.</description>

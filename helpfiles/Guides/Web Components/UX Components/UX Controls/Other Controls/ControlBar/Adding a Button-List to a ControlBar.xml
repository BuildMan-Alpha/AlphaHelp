<topic>Adding a Button-List to a ControlBar</topic>
<description>A common pattern in mobile apps is to have a button bar at the bottom of the screen with a series of buttons that allow you to select the active Panel that is shown on the device. Typically, these buttons are spread out so that they fill the width of the screen. The button-list control is ideal for implementing this pattern.

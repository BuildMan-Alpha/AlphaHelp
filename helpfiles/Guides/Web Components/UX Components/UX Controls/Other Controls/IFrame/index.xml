    <description>IFrame controls allow for the display of webpages inside of an application. Many websites place no restrictions on 
        whether or not they can be displayed in an IFrame. Websites such as www.google.com and www.yahoo.com, however, do have internally 
        defined restrictions that will cause the site to not be displayed in an IFrame control.

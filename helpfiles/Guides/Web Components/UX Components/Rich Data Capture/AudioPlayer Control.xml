            <description>This will insert a control into the UX that looks like this:</description>

                <p>Since the AudioPlayer is a data bound control, it has a [{dialog.object}.setValue()] and a [{dialog.object}.getValue()] method.</p>
                <p>To set the audio file that you want to play back you use the *[js:{dialog.object}.setValue()]* method</p>
                <p>For example:</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[{dialog.object}.setValue('MYAUDIOCONTROL','stream:http://audio.wgbh.org:8004');
]]></example>

                <p>In this case the AudioPlayer value is being set to a 'stream' - (a continuous audio stream) rather than a file.</p>
                <p>After the stream is ready to play, the AudioPlayer appearance will change to this:</p>
            </description>

            <description>
                <p>While the stream is loading (i.e. before it is ready to play), the text 'Stream', shown in the above image, will say 'Loading...'.</p>
                <p>All of the text messages shown in the control are customizable in the AudioPlayer *[ui:Control properties]*.</p>
                <p>In this next example, the AudioPlayer value is set to a file URL:</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[{dialog.object}.setValue('MYAUDIOCONTROL','http://s3.amazonaws.com/alphaVideos/theway.mp3');]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>In the case where the AudioPlayer value is set to an audio file (not a stream), its appearance will change as follows once the audio file is ready to play:</description>

                <p>When the user taps the Play button, the audio starts to play back. The number on the right side indicates the duration of the audio file. Before playback starts, or when playback is paused, the fast forward and fast reverse buttons (on either side of the Play button) will skip to the beginning or end of the audio clip (if you tap on them). However, if you press and hold, they will rewind or fast forward in 2 second steps.</p>
                <p>The top bar shows the progress as the audio file is being played. The number on the right hand side shows the duration of the audio file. The number on the left hand side shows how much of the audio file has been played. The buttons on each side of the Play button allows you to skip forward and back in the file.</p>
            </description>
            <note>The AudioPlayer control cannot play audio files that are hosted on the Alpha Anywhere server. It can play files that are hosted on Amazon S3, or, in the case of a PhoneGap application, files that are stored in the file system on the device.</note>

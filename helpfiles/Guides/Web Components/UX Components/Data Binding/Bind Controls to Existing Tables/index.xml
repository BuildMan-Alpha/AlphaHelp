    <description>Maps, or "binds", the controls in the UX component to fields in one or more existing tables in a database.</description>
    <discussion>Use this command once you have designed your UX and added controls to it. This command allows you to bind the controls in your UX to fields in one or more tables. The binding information that you specify using this command can then be used in the 'afterDialogValidate' event to save the data that the user submitted to the tables.</discussion>

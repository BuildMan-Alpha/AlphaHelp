    <description>Fires after the user is authenticated. The event fires regardless of whether the authentication was successful or not.  The e.loginSucceeded flag indicates if the login was successful or not. An important use of this event is to force a reload of the component on login. See the discussion below on 'Forcing a Reload of the UX Component After Login' for more details. This event can also be used to set the 'friendly user name'. The 'friendly user name' is made available in client-side 'afterLogin' event. It can also be used in client-side watch expressions.</description>

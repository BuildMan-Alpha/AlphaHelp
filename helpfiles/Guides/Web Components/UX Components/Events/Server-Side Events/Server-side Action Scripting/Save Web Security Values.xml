   <description>The 'Save Web Security Values' action saves the values entered into the username, password, and group 
       fields into a web security system. This action is frequently used in combination with the Validate Web Security 
       action, where the usernames and passwords that users enter are first validated before being saved. 
       For more on implementing the 'Save Web Security Values' action see the [Validate Web Security] guide. 
       Use of the 'Save Web Security Values' action is described in [this video]. 
       This is the second video in a five part series on security.

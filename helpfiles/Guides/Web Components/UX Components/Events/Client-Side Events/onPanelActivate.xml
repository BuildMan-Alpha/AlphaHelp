    <description>This only applies if the UX is embedded in a Panel Card in a parent UX. 
        The event fires when the Panel Card in which the component is embedded gets focus. 
        IMPORTANT: This event will only fire if the UX was given an EXPLICIT ALIAS when embedded into the 
        parent UX!!

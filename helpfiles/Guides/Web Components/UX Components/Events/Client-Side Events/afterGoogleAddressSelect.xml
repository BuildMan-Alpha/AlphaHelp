    <description>The afterGoogleAddressSelect event is called after an address is selected from the Google Address Autocomplete list. The event provides access to the *[js:place]* object. The *[js:place]* object contains information about the address selected by the user. You can use the afterGoogleAddressSelect event to define a custom mapping of data from the *[js:place]* object to controls in the UX Component.</description>

     <description>Fired for each resource listed in the manifest file as it is being fetched. 
         You can use this event to show progress as the cache is downloaded. For example, set the 
         innerHTML of a div using this Javascript (which uses the 'loaded' and 'total' properties 
         in the 'event' object passed into the event handler): 
         " + e.event.loaded + 'of' + e.event.total; 
         Notice: Firefox does not expose the .loaded and .total property (as of v29)

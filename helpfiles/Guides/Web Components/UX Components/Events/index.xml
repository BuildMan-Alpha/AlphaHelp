    <description>Whenever a control or some other feature us added to a UX component it usually comes with some 
        event handles. Events are simply a way of specifying where you want some action or bit of code to run in an application, 
        whether on the server-side or the client-side. It is easy to tie actions and/or custom code to an event in the UX Component on both 
        the Client-Side Events and Server-Side Events pages. Simply highlight the event in the list on the right and then define what happens in 
        during that event in the workspace on the left.</description>

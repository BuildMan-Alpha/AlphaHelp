			<description>A repository is a table (either .dbf or SQL) where a web application can read or write data. The data are typically items such as email templates, or saved queries, or other settings. The details of the repository (e.g, connection string, table name, and field map) are defined in the Web Project Properties dialog. For the most part, the repository is for internal use by the Components, but developers can also make use of it.

 To support your use of the repository, the following Xbasic functions can be used in your applications:

The easiest way to find this information it to navigate to this screen in the Microsoft SQL Azure Administration page, then click the 'Connection Strings' button shown below</description>

			<description>This will bring up a dialog and you will be able to pick out the server address and user name.
The server address will look something like this:
</description>
			<example><![CDATA[tcp:xyzab9ab8z.database.windows.net
]]></example>
			
		</section>

			<description>The user name will have your user name followed by '@' and then some portion of the server address:
For example:</description>
			<example><![CDATA[Fred@xyzab9ab8z
]]></example>

                        <p>The Web Security Framework is integrated into the Alpha Anywhere Application Server. When the security framework is turned on, the server automatically checks every requested page or file for proper security clearance from information saved in memory. The server checks the page or file permission and will return the requested file if it is permitted within the security framework for the project containing the file. If the page or file is not allowed, the server automatically checks the security configuration to determine the proper response.</p>
                        <p>This process is repeated for every page and file request, including images, CSS style sheets, and JavaScript files. If a field on a component is not available to the user, the Application Server will remove it from the component on the page returned to the user. If a menu entry is not available to the user, its link will be disabled.</p>
                        <p>The following picture shows how the security framework categorizes pages, controls on grid and dialog components, and menu entries. Any page can be in one of three categories:</p>

                    <description>There are a number of easy to use dialogs available to configure the security for a project. When a project is initially created there are no security files. The top menu on the Web Projects Control Panel has a Web Security Button. Open the Security Settings dialog, where various security options can be assigned. You must have at least one page defined in the project to build the security settings. The other menu options are disabled until these security settings have been defined. The Security Settings dialog has many options to configure the web security or turn it off completely. Some of these options include requiring a password, configuring user ID and password validations, determining how to respond to an incorrect login, allowing the user to change their password, user id and password recovery, and many other options.

                    <description>After you have defined all desired security parameters, you may build a login component. After you build the login, you may add it to a page. As with other components, parameter overrides on the page may modify the component's messages and style sheet(s). All of the code to validate the user and respond to the login actions is included within the component. The developer does not have to add any code to any page to implement security. Since the login page may not have existed prior to setting the initial security parameters, reopen the Security Settings dialog and add the login page name to the redirect options desired. You can open the Users and Groups dialog to define the users and groups. The fields shown when entering or editing users are determined by the security parameters selected. Not all possible fields may be shown. The security system includes an option to activate a special field named 'ulink'. The value entered in the 'ulink' field can identify a related user record in an external table. There are options on the dialog to import user information from existing tables or export security data to an external table. The users, groups, and permissions tables are defined and controlled by the security system.

                    <description>The next dialog in the security system is the Page Security dialog The Page Security option on the Web Security Menu dialog to open the Page Security dialog. This genie assigns permissions for all pages within the project. Pages may be always allowed or require a login. If any page requires a login, you must assign one of more groups to it. Some pages may not have any assess defined. The server will automatically deny or allow these pages, based on the project's security configuration. After configuring the page assignments, you may publish the page security file from the menu or from the Web Projects Control Panel.  After you have defined and published the Security Settings, Login component, Users and Groups, and Page Security, the security system is ready to go. The server that contains the published files will automatically check all page and file requests for proper security clearance. If you make a change is made to any configuration parameter and republish the security files, the next page request will automatically use the new settings.

Select this option to enable security at the component level. When selected, components and reports on virtual pages are 'Always Denied' by default and must be have permissions set. Grids on pages use the page permission. If this option is checked an 'Enforce security at the component level for AJAX components' option appears below it in the 'Customize Options' list.</description>

                            <description>AJAX enabled components on pages use the page permission. Checking this option will force all Ajax actions to use the component security permissions defined in the Web Security instead of the page permission. All components opened by Javascript or by virtual pages always use the component security permissions if component security is enabled. This option appears if the Enable component security for 'virtual pages' option is checked.

                            <description>The security settings are cached on the server for improved speed and are not automatically updated when the new settings are published. The cache lifetime (in seconds) determines how often the server will check for updates. A value of 300 will allow the server to check for new published settings every 5 minutes. Set the value to 0 to never check for updates.</description>

                                <p>Alpha Anywhere uses a server cache to hold security settings for an application. The cache is cleared when the application server is started and restarted. The security settings for an application are loaded into the cache when the first request is made for the application. The security cache on the local application server running in the current Alpha Anywhere instance is cleared when anything is published to Local Webroot. Therefore any changes to the settings will be reflected in the next request to the local server after publishing any file from the project.</p>
                                <p>If revised security settings are published to a remote server, the remote server cache is NOT cleared after publish. Therefore any changes made to security settings are NOT applied until the cache is reloaded.</p>
                                <p>The cache lifetime (in seconds) determines how often the server will check for updates to the security files. A value of 300 (the default) will allow the server to check for new published settings or values every 5 minutes. If new security files were published and the cache lifetime has not expired, they will not be applied until the next time scheduled for an update check.</p>
                                <p>Set the value to a few seconds if publishing to a remote server and the new values should be loaded as soon as possible. This may cause a slight speed impact and should only be done for testing.</p>
                                <p>Set the value to 0 to never check for updates. This would be a recommended value for a production server where security updates are rare. If a change is published, stopping and restarting the server will clear the cache and force a reload of security settings.</p>

In this example Hello_World.a5w is a redirect page and so can not be altered directly in the 'Page and Folder Permissions' tab. In fact, if you click on a redirect page Alpha Anywhere will only show one option 'Always Allowed by Current Security Settings' on you permissions list. See the 'Login Options' tab under the 'Web Security Configuration' Option to change a redirect page.</description>

                            <note>When security is activated, files with these extensions must pass through security just like every other request. For many projects it is limiting not to have global access to such file extensions; particularly given the fact that these extensions can be required to have permissions or even login requests at the folder level. This is why, by default, these file extensions are set to 'Always allowed'. However, it is still possible to put such permissions in place if you so choose. </note>

                    <description>
                        <p>Web security is normally set for a specific physical page, or for controls and fields within a web component. 'Page Security' can limit access to a physical page based on the current logged in user permissions. The use of AJAX techniques allows Reports and AJAX enabled components to open in a 'virtual' page. An existing physical page uses Javascript to make a request to the server to construct the grid or report. This call does NOT request a physical page. The returned content is placed in a <![CDATA[<div>]]> or <![CDATA[<iframe>]]> on the page by Javascript. Because these AJAX requests do not open an actual page, 'Page Security' can Not be used to limit access to Reports and AJAX enabled components opened by request.</p>
                        <p>'Component security' allows setting permissions for Reports and AJAX enabled components when they are requested directly by an AJAX call the permissions set in 'Component Security' are NOT used if the Report or AJAX enabled component is opened by requesting a physical page.</p>

                        <p>The requires login option is the third option on the list that appears when you set a permission or permissions for a single or selected group of components. If you check this option a dialog will appear to ask you which groups you would like to be able to see the login. After setting who will be allowed to see the component click Ok.</p>
                        <p>The component with the 'Requires login' permission should now have a lock icon next to it in the Component Permissions list. If a component requires a login you should select at least one group for that component in the dialog that loads after clicking 'Requires Login'. Otherwise, if you click OK, you will get the following error message:</p>

                        <p>On the Publish Security Files page, you are presented with several choices. Under *[ui:Select Profile:]*, selecting the Local Webroot profile simply publishes your project to the local folder on your machine where all the a5W files are stored.</p>
                        <p>There is also the Select the Publish Option that presents you with two possibilities, to publish Configuration and Page Security Files and/or to publish Data Tables for Users and Groups. Having this distinction makes it possible to update your security without necessarily overwriting all of your security settings. For example, you might have already configured the Web Security and Page security on a project to your liking but would like a way to update the User and Group data without altering the rest of your project security. This gives you a way to do that.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, the Publish new or modified files only option lets you selectively publish new files. You should uncheck this option to publish files even if they have been previously published.</p>

                    <description>
                        <p>The Alpha Anywhere web security system also includes a number of options designed to assist the developer in maintaining the system. You may access and edit the security related fields in the user table from the Users and Groups dialog or from a web based form.</p>
                        <p>A developer may design a standard UX Component following some simple rules and then very easily add the capability to populate the form with an existing user record, create a new user record, validate all data entered, and then save the results. This is done with a few simple function calls added to the UX Component server events. You can then add the UX Component to a page to allow editing the information directly on the web.</p>
                        <p>The users and group assignments shown on the Users and Groups dialog may not be the same as the values used by the application on the server. All of the web security tables are published to the application folder on the server and do not reside in the same location as other data files. If the security configuration allows a web user to edit information online, the user information in the published location will be different than in the local files.</p>
                        <p>The Web Security Menu has an additional option named Utilities. This opens the Retrieve Web User Data dialog. This option will retrieve the data on the server for the application and replace the local user files with the user files from the published location. All existing local user, group, and permission data will be replaced with the data retrieved from the published files. This option is also available from the Users and Groups dialog Import Users option.</p>
                        <p>Additional functions are available for use on a web page to return information about a current logged in user. This information can include almost any data from the user record and limited information about the security group assignment for the user. A security settings option exists to automatically create a session variable to hold a value from the user security table 'ulink' field if the field is activated. This information could then be used for other purposes, such as filtering records for display.</p>

Security settings are unique to each project.</description>

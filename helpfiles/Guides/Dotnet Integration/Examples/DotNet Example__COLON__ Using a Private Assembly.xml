            <description>The Xbasic code below loads the MyCSLib.dll and registers classes available in the DLL. If class registration succeeds, it creates a MyCSClass object and performs several operations using the class:</description>
            <example><![CDATA[dim Sv as DotNet::Services
dim assy as DotNet::AssemblyReference

'Update assy.FileName to use the location where the 
'MyCSLib.dll file is located on your system:
assy.FileName="c:\path\to\MyCSLib.dll"

if .not. file.exists(assy.FileName)
    ui_msg_box("can't find file",assy.FileName)
    end 
end if

rc = sv.RegisterClass("My","Class","MyCSLib.MyCSClass",assy)

if rc then
    dim cl as My::Class
    dim result as c
    result=cl.DoSomething()
    result= result + crlf() + cl.MyProperty
    showvar(result)
else
    ui_msg_box("MyCSLib Demo","MyCSClass class not registered")
    'Note: if you get here, try closing and restarting Alpha Five
    'It usually means a previous registration failed
    'It can also mean that you put a downloaded file in a protected spot, such as C:\
    'You can right-click on the DLL file from Windows Explorer and unblock it.

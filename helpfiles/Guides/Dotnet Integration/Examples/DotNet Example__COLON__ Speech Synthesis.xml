    <description>This sample demonstrates loading, registering and using a .NET class from a DLL in the standard location.</description>

        <p>Paste the code below into an Xbasic script and run it. Make sure the sound on your computer is turned on.</p>
        <p>We need specify the assembly filename for System.Speech.dll because its assembly is not preloaded. If you take the assy parameter out of the RegisterClass call, the registration will fail.</p>

                <p>The MSDN documentation for speech recognition and speech synthesis is *[extlink:here@http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg145021.aspx]*.</p>
                <p>This sample runs on the desktop. To create sound on a Web site that will play in a browser is somewhat more complicated.</p>
                <p>The logic of this sample has been wrapped up in the new Xbasic [TextToSpeech Function].</p>

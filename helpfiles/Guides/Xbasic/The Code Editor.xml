	<description>You write Xbasic scripts in the Code Editor. The Code Editor is a multi-tabbed window that allows you to edit multiple scripts at the same time. The Code Editor always includes at least one tab called the Interactive window where you can test individual lines of Xbasic code and see immediate results. For more information on using the Interactive window, see Testing Xbasic Statements in the Interactive Window.

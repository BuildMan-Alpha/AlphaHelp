	<description>By default, the Xbasic window shows the Raw Xbasic code for the operation. Raw Xbasic means the code shown is the exact code for the currently defined operation. It's a direct translation of what's in your Operation Card.
The Raw Xbasic view is great for seeing what's going on behind-the-scenes when you are creating an Operation, but Raw Xbasic has little meaning outside the Operation Card. That's where the Processed Xbasic view comes in.
Using the radio buttons, you can switch the view between Raw Xbasic, Processed Xbasic, and Processed without Confirmation dialogs.

			<title>Processed without Confirmation Dialogs</title>
			<description>Switching to this code view is the same as the Processed view, but without any confirmation dialog boxes with the script is executed. This code executes the script silently without any visual confirmations.</description>

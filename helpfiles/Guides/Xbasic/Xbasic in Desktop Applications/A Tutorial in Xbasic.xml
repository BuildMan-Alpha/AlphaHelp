    <description>Xbasic is Alpha Anywheres built-in programming language. Out of the box, Alpha Anywhere is a powerful database and application development software package. You can use Alpha Anywhere for lots of different information management needs without doing any programming by using the Alpha Anywhere menus, commands, and Genies.</description>

                    <note>Genies are sequences of commands that Alpha Anywhere performs to automatically accomplish various tasks.  After you answer a series of questions about what you need to do, Alpha Anywhere figures out the best way to accomplish the task and runs it. For example, Alpha Anywhere includes an Import Data Genie that guides you through incorporating existing data from external files into an Alpha Anywhere database. Genies and the Alpha Anywhere commands enable you to do a lot; Programming with Xbasic gives you even more control and options.</note>

                        <p>However, learning Xbasic will provide you with the tools to do much more with Alpha Anywhere. Mastering Xbasic will open up vast new opportunities for you to create highly customized applications and will allow you to manipulate your data in just the way you want. And the new additions to the Xbasic commands in Version 5 provide you with the power to design and develop applications using the latest Windows techniques, structures, and tools.</p>
                        <p>Xbasic is a very rich programming language with literally hundreds of commands, so it is not possible to learn everything you can do with Xbasic in this volume. You will get a good grounding in basic programming concepts that you should understand in order to use Xbasic efficiently. You will want to refer to the Alpha Anywhere Xbasic Reference Guide to explore all the different options that Xbasic offers and you should experiment with different Xbasic techniques and commands to really learn by doing. We think programming is creative and fun and we hope you will too.</p>

                    <description>You should already be familiar with Alpha Anywhere menus, commands, and workspace creation and use. For example, to create a new workspace, select the File > New Workspace command from the Alpha Anywhere Main Menu.</description>

                    <note>Programming concepts deal with the terminology and definitions that you should understand in order to get the most out of programming. In the next section, well introduce you to variables, storage, commands, functions, expressions, scripts, objects, events, and programmatic flow control. But, relax, Xbasic makes all this stuff powerfully easy!</note>

                    <description>When you select the Tables/Sets tab and click the New command, Alpha Anywhere presents you with several options for creating a new Table or Set. You can create a New Table or a New Set using the respective commands. You can also create a table or set by using the Genie. If you choose to create a table directly, Alpha Anywhere will immediately display the Table Editor where you can define the name, type, width, and other characteristics of your tables data fields. On the other hand, if you chose the Create using Genie command (see Figure 2), Alpha Anywhere will ask you what kind of table you want to create and it will automatically define a table structure for you (which you can then modify) in the Table Editor.</description>

                    <important>
                        <p>While Alpha Anywhere offers the ability to create tables from within the IDE (DBF tables), it is recommended that you use a SQL Data Source for web and/or mobile applications.</p>

                    <note>Code is a name for programming commands. All computers perform tasks according to the instructions that they are told to perform. You create the instructions using a computer language. The language of computer instructions of Alpha Anywhere is called Xbasic. Xbasic is made up of commands (words) that direct the computer to perform certain actions.   There are certain rules (syntax) you must follow when you specify the Xbasic commands you want the computer to process. When you create a file or set of Xbasic commands we call that file an Alpha Anywhere script. The name script is related to a movie script. Just as a movie script tells the actors what to say and do, an Alpha Anywhere script contains Xbasic commands that tell the computer what you want it to do.</note>

                    <description>Once a table is defined, you can use the other choices on the Alpha Anywhere Control Panel (see Figure 3). You can create Forms and Browses to use for viewing, entering, and modifying your data. You can design Reports, Letters, or Labels to use in reviewing, displaying, and printing your data. And you can define an Operation to manipulate, transfer, search, and summarize your data.   Finally, you can create Code or programming commands.  The code you create is stored in text files that are called scripts. A script (which contains a sequence of Xbasic commands) can be re-used or run. When Alpha Anywhere runs a script, it performs all the Xbasic commands that are in the script.</description>

                    </figure>
                    <note>The Code Library is a repository where you can locate scripts or portions of scripts that are useful across different applications. This allows you to easily re-use scripts without having to recreate them.</note>

                <section>
                    <description>A script is a text file containing valid (syntactically correct) Xbasic commands that Alpha Anywhere processes and executes. When you create a new script in the Control Panel Code section, you will give the script a name (i.e., the text file that contains the Xbasic commands is named just like any other file on your computer). Alpha Anywhere scripts are stored and associated with the currently active workspace However, Alpha Anywhere contains a special area called the Code Library that lets you easily share script files among different workspaces. Below, Figure 4 shows the Code tab shows other types of files besides scripts. functions (a special type of script) are listed here as well as Custom menus, toolbars, and graphic image files. </description>

                        <p>For example, if you open the Control Panel Code tab panel for the "Phone Messages" (or "Learning Xbasic") sample database application, you will see the names of all the scripts created for use in the application. The first script is named Chng Msgs Dsply Order (which stands for Change Messages Display Order) as shown in Figure 4 above. When you ask Alpha Anywhere to perform the commands in a script, you specify the script name.</p>
                        <p>Some scripts are already named in Alpha Anywhere. There are special scripts in Alpha Anywhere called events. Events are files containing Xbasic commands (you will learn more about events a little later), just like scripts, but they are already named and associated with specific Alpha Anywhere components.</p>
                    </description>
                    <note>Events are pre-named Alpha Anywhere scripts. You define what Xbasic commands are executed when an event is triggered, but events are already built-in (named) in Alpha Anywhere. Events are part of Alpha Anywhere components. For example, a button control on a form has events. One button control event is named OnPush (which is named for the event that occurs when you push that button). When you first create a control there are no Xbasic commands defined for the OnPush event. You add those commands to control what happens when that button is pushed.</note>

                <section>
                    <description>As you have learned, a script is a sequence or listing of Xbasic commands. Xbasic commands perform Alpha Anywhere tasks. For example, here is an Xbasic command:
</description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[Form.View(Administration) ]]>
                    </example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>
                        <p>If Alpha Anywhere encounters this command in a script, it performs the action this command specifies. The first word in this command is Form which tells Alpha Anywhere you want to do something with a form. Next comes a period and then the word View. View signifies that you want a form to be displayed or viewed on the screen. Finally, in the parentheses, you specify the name of the form that you want displayed. (This name must be enclosed in parentheses.) So, assuming that a form named Administration exists in the current database, Alpha Anywhere will display that form on the screen.   If there are more commands in the script, Alpha Anywhere will continue with the next command.</p>
                        <p>For example, after loading the form Administration you might want to display the last record in the table. This Xbasic command will do that:</p>
                    </description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[Administration.Fetch_Last()]]>
                    </example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>We can use these two commands together in a complete two line Xbasic script.</description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[Form.View(Administration)
Administration.Fetch_Last()]]>
                    </example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>If they are saved in a script named Load Last Person, then whenever we want to display the last person using the Administration form, you can run the script Load Last Person.</description>
                    <figure>
                        <link>images/LB_edit_contacts_fetch_last.gif</link>
                    </figure>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>
                        <p>You can do the very same things done by the Load Last Person script in Exercise 1 using Alpha Anywheres menus and buttons. Its a simple matter to load the Administration form using the View button on the Control Panel and then pressing the Last button to load the last record as shown in Figure 10.</p>
                        <p>But heres the interesting part! When you click on the buttons like the Last button, Alpha Anywhere is actually performing the same Xbasic commands that are in the Load Last Person script you examined above. When you press the Last button Alpha Anywhere performs the Xbasic command CURRENT_FORM_NAME.Fetch_Last() (where the actual name or reference to the current form is substituted in the Xbasic command for CURRENT_FORM_NAME ).</p>
                        <p>In fact, Xbasic is such a powerful language, that most of the Alpha Anywhere menu commands, buttons, and screens are Xbasic commands and scripts themselves. This means that the more Xbasic commands you learn, the more you can customize your applications to look, perform, and execute commands just the way you want them to.</p>
                        <p>Keep in mind that Alpha Anywhere is running Xbasic behind the scenes when you use the built-in Alpha Anywhere menus and commands. And, as you will see later on, Alpha Anywhere can actually write Xbasic code for you! Action scripting consists of Alpha Anywhere Genies that ask you what you want to accomplish and then create scripts automatically. You can modify the code to tweak it in just the way you want, but you save the time and effort of starting from scratch.</p>
                        <p>In Figure 11 you can see the choices available to you when you create a new script. In this case, we clicked on the Code Tab in the Control Panel and then clicked the New button.</p>
                        <p>When you select the New Database  command, Alpha Anywhere prompts you for a database name and then brings you to the Control Panel where you can begin to design any of the components for your new database system. Typically, you begin by designing the tables that store the data pertinent to your new database.</p>

                    <steps>
                        <step>
                            <description>Open the "Phone Messages" (or "Learning Xbasic") database. (If the "Learning Xbasic" sample database is not included in your list of sample databases, upgrade to the latest Alpha Anywhere patch.) To open the database, display the Select Database screen, which comes up automatically when you start Alpha Anywhere. If you see the News and Updates screen, switch to the Database and Tasks tab. Click on Sample and Tutorial databases..., select Learning Xbasic, press OK, and you will create a working copy of the sample database in your documents folder. </description>

                                        <p>An editor is just like a word processing program. The Alpha Anywhere Code Editor is where you create Xbasic scripts by typing Xbasic commands on each line. The Code Editor can be directly launched in many different ways (see notes to Step 8 in the exercise). The Code Editor also loads automatically when you create scripts for Alpha Anywhere events (more on this later).</p>
                                        <p>In Step 8, you opened an existing script for design or editing. This script appears on the screen in the editing window. The Code Editor has two tabs.</p>
                                        <p>The active (foreground) tab shows the script you are currently editing. The name of the script appears in the tab. An asterisk after the name indicates the script has been changed but those changes haven't been saved. When you create a new script, the name will be Untitled_# (where # is a number, 1, 2, etc.). You name a new script when you save it by selecting the Save or Save as commands.</p>
                                        <p>The other tab in Figure 8 is labeled Interactive. This is a special window where you can type and execute Xbasic commands interactively or at once line by line. Using the Interactive Window allows you to immediately test and see what Xbasic commands do. You will try this out in upcoming exercises.</p>

                                        <p>Running a script means that Alpha Anywhere runs or executes each of the commands in the script line by line. Some commands will loop back and execute certain lines a number of times before proceeding; Other commands might extend over many lines of typed text but are treated when entered correctly as one command. When you click on Run the Administration form loads and the last record is fetched as shown below in Figure 9. The primary index for this table is by last name, so the Fetch command loads the last record by that index.</p>

                                        <p>Alpha Anywhere can run multiple tasks at the same time. In Figure 9, you see the Administration form loaded because you ran (executed) the Xbasic commands in the script that you were viewing in the Code Editor window. The Code Editor is still running and still displays the scripts you are working with. And the Control Panel window is also still running. All three of these active Alpha Anywhere tasks are shown on the Window bar near the bottom of the screen. (The Window bar itself is turned on or off using the View drop-down menu.)</p>
                                        <p>If you click on any of the three buttons on the window bar, your active window will change. A depressed (figuratively speaking!) button indicates the current active (foreground) window.</p>

                        <p>You can do the very same things done by the "Load Last Person" script in Exercise 1 using Alpha Anywhere's menus and buttons. It's a simple matter to load the "Administration" form using the View button on the Control Panel and then pressing the Last button to load the last record as shown in Figure 10. </p>

                        <p>But here's the interesting part! When you click on the buttons like the Last button, Alpha Anywhere is actually performing the same Xbasic commands that are in the "Load Last Person" script you examined above. When you press the Last button Alpha Anywhere performs the Xbasic command CURRENT_FORM_NAME.Fetch_Last() (where the actual name or reference to the current form is substituted in the Xbasic command for CURRENT_FORM_NAME ).</p>
                        <p>In fact, Xbasic is such a powerful language, that most of the Alpha Anywhere menu commands, buttons, and screens are Xbasic commands and scripts themselves. This means that the more Xbasic commands you learn, the more you can customize your applications to look, perform, and execute commands just the way you want them to.</p>
                        <p>Keep in mind that Alpha Anywhere is running Xbasic "behind the scenes" when you use the built-in Alpha Anywhere menus and commands. And, as you'll see later on, Alpha Anywhere can actually write Xbasic code for you! Action scripting are a set of Alpha Anywhere Genies that ask you what you want to accomplish and then create scripts automatically. You can modify the code to tweak it in just the way you want, but you save the time and effort of starting from scratch.</p>

                    <description>
                        <p>Action Scripting is an alternative way to create an Xbasic script without just typing in Xbasic commands. When you create a new script, you can choose to go directly to the Code Editor or use the Action Scripting Editor.</p>
                        <p>The Action Scripting Editor presents you with Categories and Actions for a myriad of Alpha Anywhere commands. As you select the actions you want performed Alpha Anywhere prompts you for parameters and then automatically creates the Xbasic commands to perform your requested actions.</p>
                        <p>Once a script has been created using Action Scripting, you can choose to convert the Action Script actions to Xbasic code. Once the code has been converted, you can use the Code Editor to modify the code in any way you wish.</p>
                        <p>Action Scripting is covered in more detail later in this book and in more depth in the book Introduction to Action Scripting that comes with Alpha Anywhere.</p>

                        <p>In Figure 11, you can see that one of the options on the drop-down menu when you select the New code button is the Interactive window. This window is a Code Editor like the one we used in Exercise 1 to open the Load Last Record script. In that exercise, we ran the script with the Run button. When the script ran, Alpha Anywhere performed all the Xbasic commands in the script in sequence (line-by-line) until the script ended. Of course, the script only had two lines of Xbasic code. But, the point is that the whole script is run at one time.</p>
                        <p>The Interactive window is different. The Interactive window will run each line of code as you enter it.  A line of code is entered when you finish typing a single line and then press the Enter key.  At that point, Alpha Anywhere checks the code to make sure it is valid. (If you make a spelling mistake or type an Xbasic command incorrectly you will see an error message). If it is valid, Alpha Anywhere executes the line of code right away.</p>
                        <p>For example, in Exercise 1 we looked at a script whose first line of code was:</p>
                    </description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[Form.View("Administration")]]>
                    </example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>This line of code will immediately open the Administration form when you enter it in the Interactive Window. You will try the Interactive window in the next exercise.</description>

                                        <p>Nothing seems to have happened. The cursor moved to the next line, but did anything else happen? Actually the answer is yes. Each time you enter an  expression, Alpha Anywhere checks to see if it is valid. In this case, you entered a perfectly valid arithmetic expression. And Alpha Anywhere even calculated the answer. However this particular command does not trigger anything to display on the screen   When you entered the Form.View("...") command above, Alpha Anywhere did display the form, since that command by definition causes a form to be displayed.</p>

                                    <description>Alpha Anywhere would attempt to perform the command because it is syntactically correct.

                    <description>A variable is a storage area or location in your computer's memory. You may be familiar with memory locations in most calculators. They are often labeled M1, M2, and M3 and they enable you to store intermediate results that you can then recall and use in further calculations later.
</description>
                    <note>
                        <p>A variable is a location in memory that Alpha Anywhere uses to store and recall data values. Variables are named by you. Consult Declaring a Variable for variable naming rules.</p>
                        <p>Some valid variable names are:</p>
                        <p>my_last_contact sum1 interest_paid_on x warranty_in_effect</p>
                        <p>Different variables can store different types of data. So the variables above may hold these kinds of data. Other variable types are Blob, Time, Pointer (Object Reference), Image, and Function.</p>

                        <p>An Xbasic variable is like those calculator memory areas. However, there are important differences. In Alpha Anywhere you can define as many variables as you need, within the limits of your computers memory capacity, and you decide on the name of the variables yourself.</p>
                        <p>In addition, a variable can store different types of information. In a calculator, all the values stored in a memory location are numbers. In Alpha Anywhere, you can create variables to hold character, date, logical, and pointer values, among others, as well.</p>
                        <p>Variables are similar to fields in a database table. Both of them are storage areas for data. And both of them store data of a certain type. Variables, however, only hold their data while Alpha Anywhere is running. When your application closes, any variable values used in that application are discarded.  The variable placeholder is still there, but any values stored in that variable are not. However, you can explicitly use Xbasic commands to save variable data values to a file and restore those values during another session, if necessary.</p>
                        <p>But variables are primarily used to store data that is used during an applications processing, but do not need to be kept in permanent storage. For example, you may add a variable to a form which is used to search your database. When the form is loaded, your user enters the data they are searching for into the variable. That data is used to locate the appropriate record. When the form is closed, the variable is also closed and any value (the last data searched for) in the variable is discarded.</p>

                                        <p>When you press Enter, Alpha Anywhere moves the cursor to the next line but nothing prints.</p>
                                        <p>Instead you created a variable named my_sum that is assigned (or stores) the sum of the right hand side of the expression (2+3). (The right hand side of the expression refers to the part of the line to the right of the equals (=) sign.)</p>
                                        <p>Alpha Anywhere verifies that the command you typed is valid.</p>

                                    <description>Alpha Anywhere Xbasic expressions are evaluated from right to left. This means that when Alpha Anywhere evaluates the expression you typed in step 3, the right hand side of the expression is calculated first. At this moment, while the right hand side of the expression is being evaluated, my_sum holds the value you gave it in step 2 (i.e., 25). So Alpha Anywhere adds 25 plus 100. Now Alpha Anywhere proceeds with the rest of the expression which says to assign (store) the value from the right side of the expression to the variable my_sum. So my_sum' s value (25) is replaced with the new value (125). Now the my_sum variable stores the value 125.</description>
                                    <note>Variables are so-named because the data they hold (store) can change or vary. In this step, you changed the value stored in the variable my_sum from 5 to 25.</note>

                                    <description>Can you guess the type of the variable my_sum ?</description>
                                    <note>A variable's type refers to the kind of data that a variable can store.</note>

                                <case>
                                    <description>In Step 1, you assigned a sum to a new variable named my_sum. You assigned a numeric sum (yes, there are other kinds) to my_sum. So, implicitly, you told Alpha Anywhere what kind of data the new variable will store by the type of data that you first put in that variable. This kind of variable definition is called an implicit declaration of a variables type. Alpha Anywhere figures out the variables type from the type of the data you initially put in the variable. There is also a method of explicit ly defining a variables type which we will see below.</description>
                                    <note>An implicit declaration of a variable's type is done by assigning a value to that variable. Whatever kind of value is assigned becomes that variable's type. An explicit declaration is done with an Xbasic command named DIM which we will see below.</note>

                        <p>The Xbasic TYPEOF() function provides an easy way to determine the type of a variable.</p>
                        <p>A function is a special type of Xbasic command. A function calculates or transforms information and returns a value. Typically, a function will take some information in (as parameters), manipulate that information in some way and then return a result or final value.</p>
                        <p>For example, there is an Xbasic function DMY(date) that returns a formatted date. The formal definition of this function (found in the Xbasic Reference manual) is:</p>

                        <p>Why is a variables type important? Primarily because Alpha Anywhere has to know what kind of information you are referring to when you use a variable.</p>
                        <p>For example, suppose you have an application in which you ask someone to enter the date a bill comes due. And you want to display on a form the number of days remaining from todays date until that due date. You can create a variable, lets call it *[xb:due_Date]*, on the form and define it as a date variable. Now Alpha Anywhere knows that the information your user will enter in this variable must be a valid date.</p>
                        <p>Also, since *[xb:due_Date]* is a date value, you can create an expression like this:</p>
                    </description>
                    <example code="xb">
                        <![CDATA[due_Date = date()]]>
                    </example>

                    <description>
                        <p>to calculate the number of days between todays date (the date the application is run) and the *[xb:due_Date]*.  In this expression, an Xbasic function named *[link:DATE()@api date function]* returns a date value of todays (the present) date.  (So on December 31, 2002, date will return {12/31/2002}.) When a minus sign is used with two date values, Alpha Anywhere knows to calculate the number of days between those two dates. And Alpha Anywhere knows *[xb:due_Date]* holds a date value because you defined it that way.</p>

                    <title>Naming Variables</title>
                    <description>
                        <p>When you choose names for a variable, it is a good idea to pick a name that identifies its type and what information the variable will store. So, if you need a variable to count the number of matches in a search request, you might choose a name like: *[xb:items_Found]*.</p>
                        <p>Some programmers make it a practice to include a letter signifying the variables type at the beginning. So they might name the variable above as: *[xb:n_items_Found]*.</p>
                        <p>To signify that *[xb:n_items_Found]* holds a numeric value. Some people will capitalize every word in a variable name, others like to leave the first word uncapitalized and only capitalize the rest. It makes sense to pick a system that will help you quickly remember what a variable is for when you read your program at a later time.</p>

                <section>
                    <description>Up to now, all the variables you have worked with have been declared implicitly. You created variables in the Interactive Window by simply specifying a valid variable name and then assigning it a data value. The type of the data you assigned to the variable determined its type.</description>

                    <title>DIM</title>
                    <description>
                        <p>There is an Xbasic command that can be used to define a variable and to specify its type. The command is DIM. When you use DIM, you define a variables name and the type of data it can hold.</p>
                        <p>DIM comes from the word dimension. When you define a variable, it is referred to as dimming or dimensioning the variable.  When you DIM a variable you are setting its dimensions.</p>
                        <p>For example, the following lines of Xbasic define four different variables. Defining the variables with the DIM command tells Alpha Anywhere to setup storage locations with the names and to expect those variables to store data of the type specified.</p>
                    </description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[DIM first_Name as C
DIM age as N
DIM date_of_birth as D
DIM married as L]]>
                    </example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>Once a variable has been defined with the DIM command, it is available for use in subsequent Xbasic commands.  So after issuing the commands above, you could then have two commands like this:</description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[date_of_birth = {11/21/1974}
age = int((date()- date_of_birth)/365.25)]]>

                    </steps>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>First Alpha Anywhere evaluates the sub-expression:</description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[(date()- date_of_birth)]]>
                    </example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>Alpha Anywhere substitutes the appropriate date (the current date is returned by the date() function and whatever data is stored in the date_of_birth variable. This is the number of days that have passed since the birth date. Lets say date() returns {06/15/2002} and the date_of_birth variable is equal to *[xb:{11/21/1974}]*</description>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>Then the sub-expression equals</description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[({06/15/2002} - {11/21/1974}) or 10068]]>
                    </example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>Now the expression is</description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[int(10068/365.25)]]>
                    </example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>
                        <p>Applying the parentheses rule, Alpha Anywhere calculates 100068 divided by 365.25, which equals 27.564682</p>
                        <p>Finally, the expression is now:</p>
                    </description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[int(27.564682)]]>
                    </example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>The int() Xbasic function takes a numeric value and returns the integer portion (dropping any decimal value). So the final result of the expression is:</description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[27]]>
                    </example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>This value is assigned to the age variable.</description>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>You do not have to use DIM to define variables as we have already seen. In fact, you can also use DIM to name a new variable without specifying its data type. The data type is determined only after you assign data to that variable. So you could type the following two commands:</description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[DIM age
age = "Eighteen"]]>
                    </example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>
                        <p>The DIM command tells Alpha Anywhere to set aside storage for a variable named age. But only after the second command is processed does Alpha Anywhere know to treat age as a character data type variable.</p>
                        <p>Once a variable has been assigned a value or dimmed, it can only store data of that type. If you want to change the type of data that a variable can hold, you can use the REDIM command to redefine it.</p>
                    </description>
                    <note>If any data is stored in the variable before you REDIM it, that data will be discarded</note>

                    <title>Exercise 5 - Dimensioning and using variables</title>
                    <description>Using DIM to define a variable is also known as Declaring a variable. Declaring variables with DIM at the beginning of a code file is good programming practice. It makes your variables and their types explicitly known and readily apparent for someone reading your code later.</description>

                        <step>

                    <title>Type conversion </title>
                    <description>Sometimes you may want to get data of one type out of a variable and store it in a variable that holds data of a different type. For example, suppose you have a variable defined as a character variable storing a products weight.</description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[product_Weight = 42 ' lbs]]>
                    </example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>
                        <p>You want to multiply the weight in pounds by $ .75 per pound to calculate a shipping price.</p>
                        <p>You can use a type conversion function to get the numeric information from the product_Weight variable and store it in a numeric variable.  The function that converts from a character string value to a numeric value is called VAL(). When VAL() is used on a character value, it looks for any numbers occurring at the beginning of the string, drops remaining characters, and then converts the number string (the number stored as Characters) to a numeric value. So</p>
                    </description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[VAL(product_Weight)]]>
                    </example>

                    <description>
                        <p>returns the numeric value 42.</p>
                        <p>
If you had a numeric variable named ship_Cost you could write this expression:</p>
                    </description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[ship_Cost = VAL(product_Weight) * .75]]>

                    <description>
                        <p>An object is simply a definition.</p>
                        <p>When you refer to a particular object in Alpha Anywhere, you are defining that particular object as belonging to a category of objects that have similar characteristics that you can edit and that react to actions that you can create and control.</p>
                        <p>You can specify the appearance or display of an object by manipulating its characteristics and you can determine how an object reacts to user input by writing Xbasic scripts that control what happens when an object does something or is accessed by a user.</p>
                        <p>For example, you can think of a car as an object. You may own two cars which have similar properties and actions, but, of course, behave differently according to what those properties and actions are.</p>
                        <p>Lets say your two cars are:</p>

                        <p>As you can see, what happens for each action is sometimes determined by an input from the driver. The car objects acceleration action is affected by the drivers pressure on the gas pedal.  This action also determines what value is stored in the current_Speed property. (I.e., methods can set the values of properties of objects). And the accelerate method uses the top_Speed property setting to limit how fast the car can go.</p>
                        <p>Other actions happen automatically without any driver input. The dashboard flashes when the gas drops below a certain level without any input from the driver as the monitor_Tank() action is continually performed for a car object. Make note of this -  both car objects have the same methods. One, named monitor_Tank(), however, does a slightly different action relevant to its particular object. In fact, in Alpha Anywhere the names of the methods for an object are already determined. But we can control what actually happens when that method performs its action.</p>
                        <p>In other words, objects that are built-in to Alpha Anywhere (like a form or table) have a predetermined set of methods, but you can control what actually happens when those methods are run using Xbasic.</p>
                        <p>In summary, a car object is fully defined by these properties and methods:</p>

            <sections>
                <section>
                    <description>
                        <p>So far you have learned about Xbasic variables and been introduced to using functions and expressions in Xbasic commands. Another important concept for understanding how to write Xbasic commands is an object.</p>
                        <p>All the parts of your applications written in Alpha Anywhere are objects or distinct entities. An object is a part of Alpha Anywhere that has properties (or characteristics) and methods (or scripts that do something to or with an object).</p>
                        <p>For example, tables, databases, forms, browses, reports, scripts, and even the Alpha Anywhere program itself are all objects.</p>
                        <p>You may have noticed that properties of an object are like variables. They are storage locations that hold variable data values. They are, in fact, variables that belong to and describe a specific object. In the same way, methods are like scripts. Methods are pre-named scripts that execute certain actions.</p>
                        <p>Alpha Anywhere Forms and Browses are some of the objects that you will use in Alpha Anywhere. So they have properties and methods like any other object. Setting the properties and defining the Xbasic commands that are executed by the methods are the primary means of creating a custom application in Alpha Anywhere. Now, you will look a little closer at an Alpha Anywhere object a form.  You will look at the properties and methods used to build the first form of the Phone Messages application that is included in the sample databases with Alpha Anywhere. The initial form when the Phone Messages application is started is the Sign In form shown in Figure 20.</p>

                    <note>
                        <p>The "Please Login" window shown in Figure 21 is not a form object, but a window created by an Xbasic Xdialog command.</p>
                        <p>Xdialog is a set of Xbasic commands that you can use to create pop-up windows to interact with users by displaying data or prompting users for information.</p>
                        <p>The Xdialog component of the Xbasic language is covered in detail in the Learning Xdialog book that is part of the Alpha Anywhere documentation set.</p>

                    <description>After a successful login, the form then appears as shown in Figure 22. You can see in comparing Figures 20 and 22 that the information that appears on the form changes depending on the users interaction with the form.  And the pop-up window in Figure 21 appears only after the Please Login button on the form in Figure 20 is clicked.

                        <p>All of the changes and sequence of actions that occur as this form changes are happening because either the properties of the form object are being changed or methods of the form object are being invoked (run).</p>
                        <p>In fact, many of the changes to the form shown in Figure 20 and Figure 22 are the result of changes to the properties and methods of sub-objects on the form object.</p>

                            <description>
                                <p>A sub-object is an object that is part of another object. An object, by definition, always has a collection of properties and methods that determine the characteristics and capabilities of that object.</p>
                                <p>If you read the previous sidebar that used a car as an example of an object, you can think of an engine as an example of a sub-object that is part of a car object. The engine is an object itself (as are all sub-objects) and has its own properties and methods.</p>
                                <p>For example, an engine might have a property named cylinders. And it might have a method named "Increase RPM (revolutions per minute)." Now an engine object can exist on its own. It does not have to be part of a car to have its own properties and methods. (Of course, you can't do much with an auto engine that's not in a car.) But, an engine object can also become part of a car object definition. When we define a car object by defining its properties and methods, we can also define sub-objects that are part of that car object. So our car object specification can be expanded to include a sub-object of type Engine as shown below. A partial Engine object specification is also shown.</p>

                            <description>An engine object exists within the car object. A method of a parent object may invoke a method of a sub-object (or child object). For example, car.accelerate(50) causes the engine.increase RPM(1000) method to execute.</description>

                        <p>Another term for a sub-object is child object. And, as you might expect, an object that includes or incorporates child objects is sometimes referred to as a parent object.</p>
                        <p>The Sign In form in Figures 20 and 22 is an object. It is a form object. (also referred to as an object of type form). All form objects have, by definition, the same set of properties and methods.</p>
                        <p>The way you set the characteristics of a particular forms properties and methods determines that forms appearance and functionality. This form also has numerous sub-objects. In fact, all the elements or controls that you place on a form using the Alpha Anywhere Form Design commands toolbox are objects. For example, the Sign In form in Figure 22 has a design element that is a bitmap (graphic) object. The picture of the friendly smiling message taker is a sub-object of the form itself. All of the buttons, text elements, variables and frames used in this form (the forms controls) are objects themselves (and thus sub-objects of the form). And each of these objects has its own properties and methods.</p>

                        <p>An event is a special type of object property that does not contain a value but actually is an Xbasic script. The Xbasic code in an event script is run when different types of events occur in the course of an object being used. Events are pre-defined for Alpha Anywhere objects. That is, there are a fixed set of events defined for a particular object type. However, you control what happens when that event occurs through the Xbasic commands that you define in an event script.</p>
                        <p>To return to our car analogy, a car object might have the following events:</p>

                    <description>When any of these events occur, the car performs certain actions. When you Turn on the Ignition, the car might perform all of these tasks:

If the engine wont start, light up a dashboard light.
Check the miles driven.
If the miles driven is over 100,000 then
    Check the service engine switch.
    If the service engine switch has been set (meaning the engine has been serviced)  then
        Do nothing.
    else if the service engine switch has not been set then
        Light up a Check Engine light on the dashboard
Check all the fluid levels

                        <p>All of these five steps are executed when the Turn on the ignition event occurs. When you buy a car, all the events that the car reacts to and what happens when each event occurs is already built-in to your car by the car company. With objects in Alpha Anywhere, there is a big difference. Even though the events are pre-defined for a given object, you control what happens when a particular event occurs by telling Alpha Anywhere what Xbasic commands to execute for that event.</p>
                        <p>For example, when Alpha Anywhere displays a form object, it checks to see if any events that a form object can react to (e.g., a key press or fetching a data record) have occurred. Every object has a list of events that it can react to. But you determine what happens when that event occurs. An event is a pre-named like a form property, but what happens when that event occurs is up to you. In order for an event to cause something to happen, a script of Xbasic code must be written for that event.</p>
                        <p>For example, every form has an OnActivate event (or property ) associated with its object definition. A form is activated after it is opened when it receives focus. (Focus means that the form is currently the primary object that Alpha Anywhere is dealing with.) So when a form has focus, keyboard input is directed to that form (or to a sub-object of that form). When a form object is activated, Alpha Anywhere checks the OnActivate event. If Xbasic code has been written for the OnActivate event for that form, Alpha Anywhere runs that code. If no code has been written for that particular forms OnActivate event, then Alpha Anywhere moves on without doing anything extra even though an OnActivate event has occurred.</p>
                        <p>In the next section and exercise, you will examine the Sign In form's properties and events in more detail.</p>

                    <description>If you have explored an Alpha Anywhere object of type form, you will have seen that a form object has certain properties, methods, and events that characterize the behavior of a particular instance of a form. For example, with a 'Sign In' form,  when you change the value of the Sign In form's background color property, the appearance of the Sign In object changes. Alpha Anywhere forms have events that can be defined with Xbasic scripts. When an event happens, Alpha Anywhere performs the Xbasic commands in that event's script.</description>

                <section>
                    <description>
                        <p>Keep in mind that Alpha Anywhere includes many different types of objects. All of these objects are components of Alpha Anywhere. Objects include: data tables, forms, browses, controls, the Alpha Anywhere program itself, the Code Editor, the Control Panel, etc. All of these objects have properties and methods.</p>
                        <p>Some types of objects respond to events if you write an Xbasic script for those events. System objects are objects that are always present in Alpha Anywhere, whether you are using the software interactively or with a pre-built application.  In fact, many of the objects listed above are system objects; for example the Control Panel, Status Bar, Form, Browse, Set, and Table objects, as well as the Alpha Anywhere program itself.</p>

                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>Objects that you create instances of (i.e implementations of that object's type) are based on the Table, Set, Operations, or any of the various Layout objects. For example, if you create a new workspace and define a new table named 'clients', Alpha Anywhere will then create a table type object named 'clients' with the same available characteristics (properties and methods) as the system Table object. Likewise, when a 'Sign In' form is created for an application, that object is based on the system form layout object. The technical term for creating your own object from an object type is called instantiating that object. The 'Sign In' form layout object is an instantiation of the form layout object type. You can create tables and sets, browses, forms, reports, labels, and letters and operation type objects in Alpha Anywhere. Alpha Anywhere also instantiates certain system objects itself, but you cannot create additional objects of that type yourself. (For example, you cannot create additional Control Panel objects). But you can manipulate the Control Panel system object through its properties and methods. In sum,

                                <p>A system object is an object that is built-in to Alpha Anywhere. You can't create new objects that have the same characteristics as system objects.</p>
                                <p>But system objects (which allow you to control the behavior of the Alpha Anywhere program) can be referenced and controlled (for example opened and closed through Xbasic scripts.</p>
                                <p>For example, in exercise 6, the Code Editor that you opened to view the Xbasic commands of the OnActivate event is a system object.

                    <description>Most of the objects that you will use in Xbasic scripts will be layout and table objects (or simply layouts and tables). In order to change an object's property or invoke an object method in an Alpha Anywhere Xbasic script you must know how to reference that object using object addressing.

                    <description>Object addresses are basically object names. You can refer to an object in an Xbasic script by using the object name. Earlier in this book, you saw that when you use a command from the Alpha Anywhere menus, Alpha Anywhere is in fact executing Xbasic commands to carry out your request. So if you open the Phone Messages database, and highlight the Sign In form in the Form tab of the Control Panel, and then click Form > View from the Main Menu, the Sign In form will load. When you click on Form, View, Alpha Anywhere executes these three Xbasic commands:</description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[Form.View("Sign In@e:\program files\a5v5\learning Xbasic\message_tr.dbf")
:Sign_In.resynch()
:Sign_In.activate() 
]]>
                    </example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>These commands, in turn, invoke the View method of the Form layout system object (with a form layout name as the parameter) and then the instance of the Sign In form object. The diagram below explains the components of the first and third command lines.
The first command line breaks down as follows:

</description>
                            <example>
                                <![CDATA[:Sign_In.resynch()
:Sign_In.resynch()
:Sign_In.activate()
:Sign_In:BUTTON1.activate()
:Sign_In:BUTTON3.activate()
:Script_Recorder.activate()
]]>
                            </example>
                            <cases>
                                <case>
                                    <description>
                                        <p>You should recognize some of the references to objects and methods that are shown above. Note the fourth line. In this line the BUTTON1 object (a button control) is a sub-object (or child object) of the Sign_In form object. A colon separates the BUTTON1 object and the Sign_In object. The : makes the reference to an object explicit.</p>
                                        <p>References to sub-objects can also be relative. A relative reference (without a preceding :) causes Alpha Anywhere to search for that object in the current container. A container is simply an object that can contain other objects. (The Alpha Anywhere program itself is the topmost container any window objects you reference are in the top container).</p>
                                        <p>Referring to a sub-object with a relative reference makes it easier to change your code later on or use a sub-object, such as a control, among different forms without having to change the Xbasic object references in any scripts associated with that control.</p>
                                    </description>

                        <step>
                            <description>Click on the Close Recorder button in the Script Recorder toolbar to close it.

                                        <p>Objects that contain other objects are also referred to as  containers. When you identify a sub-object in an Xbasic script, Alpha Anywhere assumes that reference is to an object in the current container. This means that you do not have to specify the container name if you are referring to a sub-object within the same container.</p>
                                        <p>For example, consider a form object named Elapsed Seconds that has a button (a control named BUTTON1). When pushed, BUTTON1 resets a counter of elapsed seconds and displays the seconds in another control on the same form (a field control named FIELD1).</p>
                                        <p>The OnPush event script for BUTTON1 has an Xbasic command:</p>
                                    </description>
                                    <example>
                                        <![CDATA[field1.refresh()]]>
                                    </example>
                                </case>
                                <case>
                                    <description>
                                        <p>This command, which runs the refresh method for the field control object, FIELD1, is referencing the FIELD1 control from the BUTTON1 control. Both FIELD1 and BUTTON1 are controls on the same form. They are both in the same container form layout object - Elapsed_Seconds.</p>
                                        <p>The Xbasic command above could have been written:</p>
                                    </description>
                                    <example>
                                        <![CDATA[:Elapsed_Seconds:field1.refresh()

                                    </example>

                                <case>
                                    <description>However the :Elapsed_Seconds is not necessary since the current container is :Elapsed_Seconds. If you leave off :Elapsed_Seconds, you must leave off the : (colon) in front of FIELD1. If you start an object reference with a :, Alpha Anywhere looks for the object starting at the top level (Alpha Anywhere itself) and not in the current container.</description>

                        <p>An explicit object reference includes the name of a parent object or the name of the object itself. If you use Xbasic code to invoke object methods with an explicit reference, then that code is limited to use with the named object. Alpha Anywhere provides object aliases to use in object references that make code transferable across objects without having to edit the code.</p>
                        <p>Some of these aliases are:</p>

                                <p>The Object Explorer is a tool available for use when you are editing a layout window object. The Object Explorer is launched from the View menu in a layout editor. The Object Explorer shows, for a give layout window object, all the sub-objects of that window (including the window itself) and a listing of all the characteristics of those objects. So you can see all the properties, events, and methods that exist for an object.</p>
                                <p>Via the Object Explorer, you can edit the properties, see all the available methods, and invoke the Code Editor to create or edit event scripts. You can also highlight any object, property, event, or method and have the Object Explorer show you the correct absolute or relative reference to that object item.</p>
                                <p>The Object Explorer window lets you identify, explore, modify, and reference objects that are part of open layout windows. So the Object Explorer can be used with Forms, Browses, Letters, Labels, etc. The Object Explorer has two main regions. In the Object Name all the objects that are part of the current open layout are listed in a tree layout (Sub or child objects, if any, are listed below each parent). The Property region lists all the properties for an object selected in the Object name region.</p>

                                <p>This form works as follows. The form property, Timer interval in seconds is set to 1. This means that the OnTimer event executes every second while the form is running. The OnTimer event script increases the elpsdsecs variable by 1 each time it executes (which is every second according to the timer interval property setting).  Button1 (Start) resets the elpsdsecs to 0, changes the Field1 control background color and refreshes the elpsdsecs variable value which is displayed by the Field1 control .  Button2 (Stop) stops updating the field1 control and resets its background color. Lets look at the Xbasic scripts for these controls.</p>

                    <description>
                        <p>Earlier we looked at a list of a form's object's events while designing the Sign In form (see Figure 25). Events are associated with objects and different objects have different types of events. However, all objects of the same type have the same set of events. That means that all form objects have the same events.</p>
                        <p>An event is something that happens to an Alpha Anywhere object. In the previous exercise you saw that the Count Seconds  form used the OnTimer event. When the timer interval property is set to a value greater than zero (say 1 second) Alpha Anywhere checks the OnTimer event whenever that interval passes (in this case every second) when the form is launched. Whatever Xbasic code has been defined for the OnTimer event is run. The OnTimer event is processed whenever the timer interval is active and it changes. Other form events are processed when the form is first opened, when the underlying record the form is synchronized with changes, and when you try to save or abandon changes to a form record.</p>

                        <p>There are numerous paths available in Alpha Anywhere to enable you to edit Xbasic scripts for an objects events. You can select the Event you wish to edit from the drop-down menu shown in Figure 34. Or you can go directly to the Code Editor, select New > Script (using Xbasic editor) and then select Layout Events.</p>

                        <p>The Count_Seconds layout contains seven objects. The form itself, two button control objects, two field control objects and two text control objects. Each of these objects has events. You can see the available events for each object using the same techniques as were just described for the form object above. However, Alpha Anywhere has a shortcut tool that enables you to quickly see and edit events directly while editing an object. This tool is the Pop-up Editor.</p>
                        <p>This list of events for the Count Seconds form above matches the available events you saw in Figure 25 for the Sign In form.</p>
                        <p>The available events are the same because both Count Seconds and Sign In are instances of the form layout object. All objects of the same type have the same set of available events.</p>

                                <p>Press the F11 key. (Alternatively, you can load the Pop-up Editor by selecting Object > Pop-up Event Editor.) The Pop-up Editor window opens. None of the events have been defined for this object yet. Events that have been defined are shown in bold.</p>
                                <p>You can see all the available events for Field1.</p>
                                <p>Compare these events to those you saw previously for the Count_Seconds form object in Figure 36. Now, instead of looking at a form layout objects events, you are looking at the events for a field control object.</p>
                                <p>[Figure_37a]</p>
                                <p>The OnFlyover event is triggered when you move the cursor over an object on a layout that you are viewing. You are working on Xbasic commands that will run when you move the cursor over any part of the field1 object when the Count Seconds form is displayed. Likewise, the OnFlyoverLeave event triggers when you move the cursor off an object. You will create code for both the OnFlyover and OnFlyoverLeave events in this lesson.</p>

                                <p>Click in the script box. The event editor is shown in Figure 38 below.</p>
                                <p>The insertion point should be blinking in the script box. Now you can type Xbasic commands as you would for any Xbasic script. Since this is an Event script that you are creating, this script will run when the OnFlyover event is triggered for this object.</p>
                                <p>From Exercise 8, you know that this form displays an elapsed count of seconds when you press the Start button. The seconds are displayed in bright green. You are going to insert Xbasic code in this script to change the seconds display color to blue whenever you move the cursor over the Field1 object.</p>

                    <title>Review of object aliases </title>
                    <description>
                        <p>If you remember the discussion on alias object references, you'll understand that Alpha Anywhere will look for this object (and its property) by starting with the top parent object of this Event. This OnFlyover event is part of the Field1 field object. The top parent of this event is the layout object that it is a part of. So Alpha Anywhere will start at the Count Seconds object (indicated by topparent ), then look for the Field1 object (indicated by :Field1 ), then look at the Font property (indicated by .Font ) and finally, the "Color" sub-property (indicated by .Color ).</p>
                        <p>The full alias reference from the top parent form is not necessary here. You can achieve the same thing by using the following code:</p>
                    </description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[This.Font.Color = "blue"]]>
                    </example>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <description>
                        <p>Alpha Anywhere will interpret the alias This to refer to the object that this event is attached to (or Field1 ).</p>
                        <p>After you have saved some code for an event, Alpha Anywhere displays the event name in bold.  Alpha Anywhere ignores events without code when those events are encountered during the course of an Alpha Anywhere program executing.</p>
                        <p>The Code Explorer provides a quick way to see and edit all objects that have events defined in a particular layout. Within the Code Explorer, you can filter and view the same event types across all objects.</p>
                        <p>The Code Explorer allows you to examine an events Xbasic commands in the right region, but you cannot edit code in that window. You must click on Edit Code and launch the Code Editor to alter an events code. You can, however, use the Clear All Flyover Events to quickly delete any code in the OnFlyover or OnFlyoverLeave events.</p>

                    <description>
                        <p>You have now learned how to program object events. In Exercise 9, you used one line of Xbasic code in each of two event scripts to change the appearance of an object (the Field1 control) that is part of the Count Seconds form.</p>
                        <p>There are basically three things you can manipulate with Xbasic commands:</p>

                    <description>
                        <p>Xbasic can be used to create, change, display, update and destroy the three Alpha Anywhere components listed above. But, Alpha Anywhere is primarily a database application development tool and, in fact, all layouts (the means by which you display windows (data)) must be associated with a table or set as its data source. Later on, you will be introduced to some Xbasic scripts that primarily manipulate tables and the data contained in them. Right now, though, you will look more closely at how you can use Xbasic to manipulate objects found on layouts.</p>
                        <p>In order to understand the examples you will read about in coming exercises, you will need to understand a little about the Phone Messages sample application and what it is designed to do.</p>
                        <p>In order to understand the examples you will read about in coming exercises, you will need to understand a little about the Phone Messages sample application and what it is designed to do.</p>
                        <p>The Phone Messages application allows the recording and retrieval of phone messages for a population of users. The users of this application can be either takers or receivers of messages (so anyone in the office can take a message for anyone else). User data is stored in the table named message_tr (where "tr" stands for takers or receivers).</p>
                        <p>Some users are designated as administrators. Administrators can do all the things that regular users can do, but they also have access to the portion of the program that enables user administration. The user administration form can be used to add, change or delete user information.</p>
                        <p>The Phone Message application begins when you launch the Sign In form. The Sign In form asks you to enter a user ID and password to gain access. As you can see from the message_tr table structure on the right, each user has a field named Tr_Administrator that indicates whether or not that user is an administrator. After you sign in, you will see one of two different menu choices depending on whether or not the id you signed in with is an administrator. Figures 42 and 43 show the way the form displays different data depending on the type of user who is logged in.</p>
                        <p>In the next exercise, you will view the event scripts that check the values of variables and then dynamically change the form display (the form object and sub objects) depending on those values.</p>

                        <p>You are looking at a portion of the same form in each of the two figures at the right. The form appears to expand the radio control choices depending on whether the logged in user is an administrator or not.</p>
                        <p>What is actually happening is that two different radio controls were placed on the Sign In form (Radio1 and Radio2). Radio1 has two choices. Radio2 has three choices.</p>

                        <p>Both radio controls are hidden when the form is initialized. After user logon, a logical form variable is_admin is set and Alpha Anywhere unhides the appropriate radio control. Another form variable (this one of type character) named user_type is set by either radio control.</p>
                        <p>After you have selected what you want to do from the radio control, the user_type variable setting is used by the OnPush event of the Next button to determine what form Alpha Anywhere displays next.</p>

                        <p>The radio1 control sets the user_type variable to either receiver or taker. The radio2 control sees the user_type variable to receiver, taker or administrator.</p>
                        <p>In the next exercise, you will see how Xbasic commands executed in different object events set these variable values and object properties to direct the flow of the application in the appropriate way (i.e., to display the correct choices for an administrator or non-administrator user. </p>

                        <p>In Exercise 10, you saw how Xbasic code in the object events determine what is shown on the form and what options are available to the user. When you signed in as an administrator in the Its For You application, the Radio2 control was enabled for you to select from three choices:  See your messages, Take messages and Manage Users.</p>
                        <p>To proceed in the application, you press the Next button. The Next button's OnPush event is shown at the right in figure 55.</p>

                    <description>The script checks the value of the is_admin variable (which was set in the event script of the Please Login button). The next_screen variable is set to the value of the choice made in either the Radio2 or Radio1 control. If is_admin is True, the Radio2 control is the active control (see Exercise 10) and next_screen is set accordingly.

So if the variable next_screen is set to receiver in the IF statement above, the SELECT command processes this command:</description>

                        <p>A debugger is tool that helps you to catch errors and validate that commands are doing what you intended when you write a program. Because they help you eliminate bugs from your program, these kind of tools are called debuggers.</p>
                        <p>The Debugger is a separate window that you can open from the Alpha Anywhere View menu or dynamically at any point in a script by using the Xbasic debug() command.</p>

                <section>
                    <description>In Exercise 10, you looked at the script for the OnPush event of Button1 and now you have reviewed the script for the OnPush event of Button2 for the Sign In form by viewing the commands in the Code Editor. When you are creating scripts like these, Alpha Anywhere provides a mechanism to see each line of Xbasic code as it is processed and to examine the values that variables take on as the code runs. This feature is the Xbasic debugger and in the following exercise, you will turn on the debugger with an Xbasic command in the Button2 script and then watch interactively as Alpha Anywhere processes the rest of the scripts Xbasic commands.</description>

                                <p>When you are in the Debugger, you have to tell Alpha Anywhere how to proceed. You have a number of options. You can direct Alpha Anywhere to execute the line it is pointing to and then pause again. You can highlight a line further down in the script and tell Alpha Anywhere to execute all the commands from the current pointer until the line you highlighted and then pause again. Or you can skip over lines or turn off the debugger and proceed normally. You can also, at any time Alpha Anywhere has paused and is waiting for your direction, type variables names in the Watches section to see what values they take on as the script executes.</p>

                            <description>Press the Trace into line of Xbasic button once. This command begins with IF is_admin THEN so if the value of is_admin is True, then the following line of Xbasic code will be executed. In fact, you can see in the Watches section that is_admin is True, so the Debugger has moved to the next line of code (though it has not executed it yet).

                                <p>Press the Trace into line of Xbasic button once. This line of code sets the variable next_screen to a value of whatever is stored in radio2.text.  Radio2 is a control on the Sign_In form. In Step 8, you left the Radio2 control set to "See Your Messages" and the text (value) of that control is therefore "receiver". (You can verify this by examining the choices list for the Radio2 control on the Sign_In form.) If you look down at the Watches section, the value of next_screen is now displayed by the debugger and indeed it is set to receiver.</p>
                                <p>The pointer symbol has advanced to the next line of the script. Alpha Anywhere is still processing the IF...THEN...ELSE...END IF command. But since the test value of the IF statement already evaluated to True then Alpha Anywhere should skip the commands after the ELSE statement. So if you press Trace into line of Xbasic the pointer symbol should move past the commands following else (since they will not be executed) and to the next Xbasic command.</p>

                            <description>Press the Trace into line of Xbasic button once. You are right! Alpha Anywhere skips the command after the CASE statement, because it did not evaluate to True. The Debugger pointer symbol is positioned at the next CASE statement.

                            <description>Press the Trace into line of Xbasic button once. This CASE statement does evaluate to True and Alpha Anywhere is ready to process the command following this CASE statement. However, this command will play a whole different script than the one you are viewing in the Debugger. If you Trace into line of Xbasic here, the debugger will load the Open Review Msg Form script into the Debugger and you will have the option of tracing through that script. You will next ask Alpha Anywhere to, indeed, run this command and execute the Open Review Msg Form script, but not to load that script into the Debugger.
</description>
                            <note>Only press the Trace into line of Xbasic ONCE in each of these exercise steps. At step 17, be especially sure to press this button ONCE or else another script will load into the Debugger. (If you would like to see this happen, you can load the next script and process its commands.) If you mistakenly start another script in the debugger, press the F5 (Go) key to execute all the commands in the script and you will return to the calling script in the Debugger.

                        <p>In Exercise 11, you saw how variables were used to hold values that determined the course of the application. For example, when you log in with a user name for an administrative user, the is_admin variable is set to True and this variable is used to determine which radio control on the Sign_In form you see next. (The is_admin variable is set in the event script of Button1 named Please sign in). Other variables set in Button1 s OnPush event script are user_id and user_name.</p>
                        <p>All three of these variables are set in Button1s OnPush event, but they are used later in the application by other scripts. You just saw Button2 s OnPush event script check the value of is_admin in Exercise 11. So a variable defined in one place in Alpha Anywhere can be accessed (i.e., you can set or get its current value) in another place. However, variables are not automatically visible (i.e., accessible) in every other part of Alpha Anywhere once they have been defined. Where a variable is accessible is called the variables scope. There are five different types of scope in Alpha Anywhere. A variables scope level is how Alpha Anywhere determines if a variable is available for use if it is defined in script A in script B.</p>

                        <p>Variables defined in the Code Editor using the Define Global Variables [v_img] button are available whenever the database they are created in is opened and are global variables available to all layouts and scripts until that database is closed (or the variable itself is destroyed in a script). Variables defined in the table editor are also global variables and are instantiated when that table is opened.</p>
                        <p>Variables instantiated in a layout can be session, layout or global variables and are created when that layout is opened.</p>
                        <p>Finally, variables created in an Xbasic script can be global, shared or local. Global variables, once instantiated, are available to any component of Alpha Anywhere while the same database is open. Shared variables are instantiated in one script and available to any scripts run from that original script. Local variables (which is the default when a script variable is created with just the DIM command and no qualifier) are only available in the script in which they are instantiated and are not visible in child scripts.</p>

                                <p>SESSION and LAYOUT variables are defined in layouts.  SESSION variables exist from the time the layout they are defined in is loaded and are available to any scripts or object events run from that layout.</p>

                                <p>In a script, when you define a variable with a DIM statement you can add GLOBAL or SHARED after the DIM command. GLOBAL makes it a GLOBAL variable. SHARED makes the variable available to any scripts that are called (run) from the current script (and subsequent scripts). If you do not use either of these two options, the variable is a local variable and only visible in the current script.</p>

                                        <p>You should define any Global variables you wish to use in the Code Editor using the View > Global Variables menu selection. ( Note :  This menu selection is available when you are editing a script or using the Interactive Window.)</p>
                                        <p>The Global Variables window has two tabs, Variable List and Initialized at Startup. You can add global variables on either tab, but if you want a global variable to persist (i.e., be stored and available the next time you open the current database) then define it using the Initialized at Startup tab. Global variables that you add through the Variable List tab will be discarded when the database is closed.</p>

                                    <title>Why Do Variables Need to be Scoped?</title>
                                    <description>
                                        <p>This question could be rephrased as why isn't every variable a global variable?</p>
                                        <p>The simplest answer is that every time you create a variable, Alpha Anywhere uses up computer memory to store the variable name and value. Especially, if you are using variable arrays, too many global variables can have an adverse impact on your applications performance (this would depend on the amount of memory and capacity of the computer in use).</p>
                                        <p>In advanced programming, it makes sense to limit the scope of variables to only the objects (I.e., scripts, layouts) that need to make use of them. This is good programming style and also helps others reading your code later to understand how a variable is being used. (It also lets you use the same variable name in different scripts to track different values. This can be a useful tool in advanced programming.)</p>

</description>
                            <note>Global variables can be defined in other parts of your application besides the Initialized at Startup tab of the Global Variables window.  As they are instantiated you can monitor all global variables from the Variables List tab of the Global Variables window.</note>

So varC_global_test is available to this form (as you would expect) since it was instantiated as a global variable when the Phone Messages database was opened. Likewise, varC_layout and varC_session display with the values they are instantiated with when this form opens.</p>

                                    <description>This is the same exact code (except for the message box's title parameters) as you saw in Step 8 for the :Button1.OnPush event. But now, there is another layer involved. The :Button2.OnPush event plays a script and that script code runs separately from the layout of the VariablesScope form. You can think of the :Button1.OnPush event script as running within the layout and the FormScopeTest script running outside the layout (though still within the layout session. So what do you think will happen to the layout variable and the session variable when the Xbasic commands of the FormScopeTest script tries to access each of them?

                                    <note>Whenever a layout is opened (viewed), Alpha Anywhere begins a new "session". Layout objects and their event scripts can access "layout" variables. Scripts launched through an object that is part of a particular layout are part of that script's session and have access to the layout's session variables.</note>

When you change the command in Step 16 from script_play() to script_play_local() you tell Alpha Anywhere to give the script access to the layout variables of the layout this script was launched from. Since the script was played from the OnPush event of a child object of the VariablesScope form layout, this script now has access to the VariablesScope layout variables. The third message box command now has access to the layout variable and displays without an error.

GLOBAL variables are, of course, available to any subsequently run scripts once they are instantiated in a script. Variables intantiated with a regular DIM command (without the SESSION or GLOBAL qualifier are "local" variables only visible in the script they are created.

                        <p>used in Xbasic to calculate a person's age. You also learned that a function is a special Xbasic command that optionally takes an input or inputs and produces or "returns" an output. In the code above, the Xbasic command int() is a function. The int() command takes a numeric input and returns the integer portion of that number. The entire expression:</p>

                        <p>evaluates to a number which is the input parameter for the int() function. So, int(24.3) would return the value 24, which is the integer portion of a number. The int() function is classified (simply for reference) as a numeric function since it returns a numeric value.</p>
                        <p>*[highlighter:A function is an Xbasic command that processes data (some of which is optionally provided to the function as input parameters) and returns a value for display, assignment to a variable, or incorporation in an expression.]*</p>
                        <p>Alpha Anywhere includes hundreds of built-in functions that can be used in any Xbasic expression or script. These functions allow you to transform data, query tables, load arrays, set values and more. Every new version of Alpha Anywhere includes new functions added to the program's built-in function list that allow you to quickly accomplish tasks that you would normally have to program yourself. The Alpha Anywhere help files group functions in the categories shown in the following table. This is simply a classification to help you understand where to look for a function depending on what you need to do. Chances are there is an Alpha Anywhere function that matches your needs already. For example, the code above is used to calculate a person's age given a date of birth. In fact, Alpha Anywhere already includes a built-in function that returns a person's age. Appropriately enough it is the age() function. In the interactive window, the function definition appears in bubble-help as below: </p>

                        <p>*[highlighter:It is not important for you to understand how a function works, only what inputs are required (if any) and what kind of output you can expect from a function.]*</p>
                        <p>You can see that the age function takes two parameters, one of which is optional. The first parameter is a date value (indicated by the 'd') named dob (which stands for date of birth). If you use the age() function with the dob parameter alone, the function returns an age as of the current date. So, in this next example, the date() function is used to verify the current date (the date this example was created) and then the age() function is called with a dob parameter.</p>

                        <p>Now the second (optional) parameter is also a date value and is named asofdate. Including this parameter has Alpha Anywhere return an age as of the input date as seen here:</p>

                    <title>Global User Defined Functions</title>
                    <description>
                        <p>Like the properties and methods and events of objects, the functions you saw in the previous section are all built-in to Alpha Four. Like object methods, you can call a function to accomplish a pre-designated task. Object events, however, you can define yourself. You control what happens when you write Xbasic code for an object event.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, you can define your own functions by writing Xbasic code. But unlike object events, which are already named, you can name your own functions. Once created you can call on that function to accomplish something that you need to repeat. It does not make sense to create a function that is only used once for a very specific task. When you have to manipulate data in a custom way that is not provided by a pre-built Xbasic function and you have to do it over and over, that is the time to create your own function.</p>
                        <p>Once a function is created and named, it becomes part of your own Alpha Anywhere set of functions. You have previously seen that one of the selections for function categories is User Defined. These functions are also called global functions. Once created, they are available to be used in any of your Alpha Anywhere applications.</p>
                        <p>A global function is like an Xbasic command of your own creation. It has a name, it can accept parameters and it can (optionally) return a value. Global functions have to meet certain criteria in order to function correctly. Alpha Anywhere makes it easy to build-your-own functions.</p>

                        <p>To recap, most functions you create are called Global functions because they are available to be used in part of your Alpha Anywhere application. However, you can create a local function. A local function is a function defined in a script or another function.</p>
                        <p>So a function script FUNCTION1 could contain a second function definition named FUNCTION2. Here is the code for FUNCTION1 :</p>

       function2 = "has already reached the big 4-0"
   else

                        <p>FUNCTION1 calls FUNCTION2. And like a local variable, a local function is only visible or available to the function it is defined within.</p>
                        <p>Whereas you would be able to call FUNCTION1 from anywhere in Alpha Anywhere, you could not call FUNCTION2 from another script.</p>

                    <description>You saw previously that you can look for a global function using the Function Finder window. There is another tool available in Alpha Anywhere that enables you to quickly lookup and identify built-in functions, global functions and other Xbasic commands, variables, and components. This tool is called the Xbasic Explorer.

                        <p>The Xbasic Explorer is available whenever you are in the Code Editor. You can load it from the toolbar by clicking on the wrench symbol [wrench_img]. Or you can select View > Xbasic Explorer  from the Code Editor menu.</p>
                        <p>The Xbasic Explorer, shown at right, is a pop-up window that shows in a tree structure the categories of all the different Alpha Anywhere components that you use when you create a script in Xbasic.</p>
                        <p>When you expand any of the nodes of the tree, you will see all of the available Xbasic entities for that category or sub-categories, if applicable.</p>

                    <description>For example, if you expand the "Functions" node, you will see the categories for all the built-in functions. If you expand one of the sub-category nodes, you will see all the functions classified in that sub-category as shown in the next figure for the date functions category.</description>

                        <p>Under the "Functions" node, you will be able to see all of your own functions. The Xbasic Explorer brings together in one conveniently accessible window all of the possible entries for Xbasic script command lines.</p>
                        <p>In addition, you can drag-and-drop any of the leaf node entries from the Xbasic Explorer into the Code Editor. This is especially useful when you are selecting objects and their corresponding methods or properties. If you drag-and-drop an object method or property, the absolute reference to that object method or property will appear in your script.</p>

                    <description>At the beginning of the book, you saw the script Choose Msg Receiver which is part of the Phone Messages database. Choose Msg Receiver is used when you take a message using the Its For You application. The script is invoked when you press the For button on the Take A Message screen. The script pops-up a dialog box as shown below.</description>

                        <p>This script is not a function nor is it attached to an object event. Most of the scripts you have analyzed up until now have been one of these two types.  Choose Msg Receiver is a Global Script. It was created in the Code Editor by using the N ew > Script using Xbasic editor command. Like a global function, it is accessible (callable) from any other script in the active database.</p>
                        <p>Unlike a function, a script does not take input parameters, nor does it return a result. But as you saw in the section on variable scoping, data can be passed to a script via shared and global variables.</p>
                        <p>Generally, you would create a global script when you want to create an Xbasic program that you can invoke in different places of your application or even share among applications. Even if you change the script slightly to accommodate different needs, it is convenient to keep the script as a separate entity (rather than attached to a specific event).</p>
                        <p>The Choose Msg Receiver script is invoked from the OnPush event of the For button with this Xbasic command.</p>
                    </description>
                    <example>

]]>
                    </example>
                    <note>The script_play command loads and runs the Xbasic commands contained in the named script. The script_play_local command makes any local variables in the calling script available to the called script. See Variable Scoping in this book for more information.</note>

                        <p>The Choose Msg Receiver script displays a list of message recipients from the message_tr table. When a recipient has been selected, fields in the Take Message form are updated to reflect the name and id of the recipient.</p>
                        <p>The script performs the following actions:</p>

                    <description>The complete script along with an analysis of how it works follows.
Various variables used in the script are declared using dim commands. These variables are all local to this script and are discarded when the script is finished running.
</description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[dim rc as N
dim selection as C

                    <description>A count of the number of records in the message_tr table is stored in the rc variable. This count is necessary so that the next two array variables, names and nameslist can be declared big enough to accommodate all the records in message_tr.</description>
                    <example>
                        <![CDATA[rc = reccount("message_tr")

                    <example>

                            <description>Variable arrays are multidimensional and accessed via their index. So a variable declared as  dim myvariable3 as C is declaring myvariable to be an array variable holding up to three possible values (sort of three similar variables accessed with the same name). Each value is assigned and accessed using the appropriate index value. Different array variable values are called elements of the array. </description>

                                <p>Pointer arrays can extend in two dimensions. A pointer array variable can be used to load all the field data of a table by record number. When a pointer array is loaded using the appropriate Xbasic command (e.g. initialize_from_table ) each index entry of the array represents a row from the table.</p>
                                <p>Each array element points to a string for each table row of every field name from the table and the fields corresponding data. The field names and values from the database become properties of each array element. Data is then accessible from the variable array by index (element) value (which displays all the properties) or by specifying the array element property you are interested in.</p>

                        <p>You have covered a lot of ground in this introduction to Xbasic. You have learned about different Xbasic commands, objects, variables, and tools and how to use them in creating Xbasic scripts and functions. And while you have learned a lot about Xbasic, there are many areas of using Xbasic that still remain for you to discover.</p>
                        <p>One of the best ways to learn more about Xbasic is to use Alpha Anywheres Action Scripting. When you use Action Scripting Alpha Anywhere actually writes Xbasic code for you.</p>
                        <p>Action Scripting is a tool that can be used when you are creating any script (whether a global script or an event script). When you build a script using Action Scripting you do not type Xbasic commands into an editor. Instead you pick from a menu of dozens of categorized actions that you wish to have your script perform.</p>
                        <p>When you select an action that you want performed, you then answer a series of questions and prompts for information where you define exactly how you want that action to behave. The Action Scripting tool then creates the Xbasic commands that will perform your desired action. However, a script created using Action Scripting displays symbols and descriptions that represent the actions. Each row of an Action Script is a separate action. Actions in scripts can be edited and modified or deleted altogether. You can string together many actions in one script and change the order that the actions are executed in.</p>
                        <p>You can also mix actions with Xbasic code. And you can convert an Action script completely into the underlying Xbasic code.</p>
                        <p>Action Scripting can be used to learn Xbasic. By creating a script first in Action Scripting, you focus on what you want the script to do, rather than how it does it. You can then convert the script from Actions to Xbasic commands and expand or modify the script directly using Xbasic.</p>
                        <p>When you choose to create a new script using Action Scripting you see the following display in the Code Editor : Picture</p>

                        <p>You can see that Alpha Anywhere generates more Xbasic commands for an action than you might have expected to perform the requested task. In creating Xbasic scripts via Action Scripting, Alpha Anywhere includes comments and a lot of error checking code. The code generated for this action makes sure that the window that contains the field you want the action to change actually exists before it tries to change the field.</p>
                        <p>By examining the code that Alpha Anywhere writes to perform Action Scripting actions, you can pick up programming skills and techniques that will improve the efficiency and reliability of your code. Action scripting can also help speed up your work. When you have a script with multiple actions, you can quickly specify tasks you want accomplished through Action Scripting.</p>
                        <p>Then you can view the Xbasic code for all of the actions in one screen. (via the All Actions tab in the Xbasic Code window). You can copy the code to the clipboard and continue working on the script using the Xbasic Code Editor and editing the Xbasic code directly if you wish.</p>
                        <p>You have reached the end of Learning Xbasic.</p>

                        <p>Hopefully, you have gotten a feel for the power and flexibility of the Xbasic commands and components. You have learned about all the major programming methods and tools that Alpha Anywhere provides with the Xbasic language.</p>
                        <p>You have seen how you can use Action Scripting to have scripts written for you. Using Action Scripting and then studying the code is an excellent way to get up to speed with Xbasic. You can learn more techniques by running the Its For You application, understanding what it does, and then exploring the scripts that are part of the application in the Code Editor.</p>
                        <p>Read the Introduction to Action Scripting and Learning Xdialog books that accompany this book to go in-depth with both of these areas.</p>
                        <p>You will soon be writing your own Xbasic global scripts, events and functions that will enable you to create database applications faster and easier than ever. Watch for new and more features in Xbasic and Alpha Anywhere coming soon.</p>
                        <p>And, finally, thanks for using Xbasic and Alpha Anywhere and Above: The Revolutionary Way To Build Sophisticated Database Applications!</p>

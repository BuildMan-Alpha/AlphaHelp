                <step>
                    <description>
                        <p>Locate the id of the Google Drive folder you want to use in your storage connection string. The id is found after the *[bold:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/]* portion of the URL for a Google Drive folder.</p>

                <p>Once you have completed all of the above, you can then create a named storage connection string.</p>
                <p>To create the names storage connection string you will need:</p>
                <p>
                    <list bullet="true">
                        <item>
                            <name>The JSON that you downloaded when you created new keys for your service account.</name>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                            <name>The id for the folder you want to point to with your named storage connection string.</name>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                </p>
                <p>Once you have created a named storage connection string for Google Drive you can then use any of the [a5storage* functions] (except *[xb:a5storage_copyFiles()]*) to read and save files to Google Drive.</p>

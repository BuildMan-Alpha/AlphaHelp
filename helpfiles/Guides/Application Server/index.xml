        <p>The Alpha Anywhere Classic Application Server handles HTTP and HTTPS requests from a client browser or server. The Application Server is responsible for handling Ajax Callbacks and translating Xbasic in .a5w pages and components (such as Grid, UX, Tabbed UI, etc) into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be executed in the client's browser. The Application Server also services other types of content - XML, JSON, multimedia, etc - that is stored in the server's file system and interacts with databases and other web services required by an application.</p>

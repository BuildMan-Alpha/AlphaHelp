    <description>Options for configuring TLS/SSL support on the Application Server.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The Application Server supports TLS/SSL for secure, encrypted transmissions. This support is particularly valuable in e-commerce applications.</p>
        <p>The Application Server responds on the port specified on the General tab of the Control Panel. If you use port 81 and enable SSL, your URL would be https://localhost:81. If you run SSL on port 443 instead, you can simplify your URL to https://localhost.</p>

            <important>If you have TLS (SSL) enabled, the Application Server will not respond to any http:// URL, no matter what number port you are using.</important>

            <title>Minimum Protocol Version</title>
            <description>
                <p>The minimum TLS protocol version supported by the Classic Application Server can be specified using the *[ui:Minimum Protocol Version]*. TLS 1.3 is the most recent protocol and generally considered to be the most secure. Setting the minimum TLS version to 1.3 will disable TLS 1.2 and provide what is currently considered the highest level of security. Note however that not all web browsers or operating systems support TLS 1.3. Site administrators should evaluate the needs of their users before modifying this setting.</p>
                <p>The following TLS protocols are available:</p>

            <title>About TLS (SSL) Certificates</title>
            <description>A certificate enables a web server to tell its web clients its name and its public key, to be used for encrypted TLS (SSL) communications. There are two types of certificates.</description>

                <item>
                    <name>Self-signed - good for testing and internal private applications, but not generally suitable for external public applications. Self-signed certificates will generally cause security warnings in web browsers because they are not issued by a well-known and trusted Certificate Authority (CA).</name>

                <item>
                    <name>Commercial - Issued by a well-known and trusted Certificate Authority (CA), such as DigiCert, Sectigo, and Let's Encrypt - good for public applications. Because these certificates are issued by a well-known CA, browsers will trust the secure connection and not prompt with any security warnings.</name>

            <steps>
                <step>
                    <description>Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the server where the certificate will be installed. Be sure to keep the private key created as part of the CSR generation. It will be needed when you receive your certificate.</description>

                <step>
                    <description>Send this information to one of the trusted companies. Typically, you will paste it into a web form, but the methods vary.</description>

            <description>
                <p>Administrative alerts can be sent from the Application Server by email and SMS.</p>
                <p>For email notifications, all that is required is a recipient email address. There is no email server configuration necessary, as emails will be sent using a special account, AppServerAlerts@alphasoftware.com. Multiple recipients may be specified by separating them with a comma.</p>
                <p> For SMS notifications, the customer must have their own Twilio account and provide the appropriate account information in the server's settings, along with the recipient SMS number. This functionality will work with a free Twilio account, but Twilio may impose limits on free accounts. Multiple recipients may be specified by separating them with a comma.</p>
                <p> Currently there are 4 different notification levels, detailed below. Each level includes all alerts from levels under it (higher number).</p>
                <p>Use the *[ui:Test Alerts]* button to test your configuration. This will send both a test email and a test SMS, if each are enabled, in order to confirm that the settings entered are working as expected.</p>

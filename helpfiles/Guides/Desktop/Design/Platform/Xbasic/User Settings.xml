				<p>You can find these settings in the *[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Alpha Software]* directory in the Registry Editor. Users are discouraged from directly modifying the system registry. Instead, use the [REGISTRY.LOAD_SETTINGS()] and [REGISTRY.SAVE_SETTINGS()] functions in your desktop applications to read and write settings in Alpha Anywhere using Xbasic.</p>

					<example><![CDATA['initialize the UserSettings variable
UserSettings.dummy = ""
REGISTRY.LOAD_SETTINGS("Init",UserSettings)
UserSettings.email.client_password = "MyNewPassword"
REGISTRY.SAVE_SETTINGS("Init",UserSettings)]]></example>

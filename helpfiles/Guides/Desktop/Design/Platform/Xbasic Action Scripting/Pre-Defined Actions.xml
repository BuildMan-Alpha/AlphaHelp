		<description>If you want a very simple button that performs a single step, the "Pre-Defined Actions" are perfect. Every command appearing on the Form menus is available as a Pre-Defined button. For example, put four buttons on a form to navigate to the first, previous, next and last record.</description>

			<note>The Events right-click menu lists the various events for the current object (i.e. the button that you have selected). Note that only the OnPush event appears in bold type. That's because the OnPush event has already been defined. </note>

			<description>The Code Editor opens and shows the script associated with the button's OnPush event.
This should look familiar. A Pre-Defined button action is a short cut for creating a simple action script with one action. The action is "Select Action from the Form Menu".
Pay particular attention to the name of the tab. You assigned the name "Navigate" to the form when you saved it. The name of the button object is "Button1." The event name is OnPush. Alpha Anywhere automatically assigned the button object name when you drew the button on the form.
</description>
			<note>You are free to change the name of any object on a form by right-clicking the object and selecting Properties... > Setup. and changing the Object Name.</note>

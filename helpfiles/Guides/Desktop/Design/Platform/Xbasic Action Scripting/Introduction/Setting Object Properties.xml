                <p>In this example, we will show you how you can attach scripts to some of the other object events. We will change the appearance of a field label when the corresponding field gets focus. This will highlight the use of the OnArrive and OnDepart events.</p>

                    <description>Click on the Customer Id field. Depending on your settings, both the field and its corresponding label may be grouped. In this case both objects will be selected. Since we want to change the property of the Customer Id field's label, click a second time on the Customer Id label. The size handles on the label should be dark, while the size handles on the field should be light (as shown below).</description>

If you did not define an OnDepart event to set the field label back to its original appearance, the field label would change to "blue, underline, bold" when Amount got focus, but would never change back to "black, no underline, normal" when the field lost focus.</p>
                                <p>To begin defining the OnDepart event, you have two choices. You can either right click on the Amount field again and select Events &gt; OnDepart, or you can click the Select Object? button in the Code Editor. Since you already know how to use the first approach, try the second one here.</p>

                <p>In addition to the full Code Editor, you can also edit event scripts in a convenient, resize-able, pop-up editor. The advantage of the pop-up editor is that it opens very quickly and it gives you an overview of all of the events that a particular object has.</p>
                <p>You access the Pop-up Event Editor in Form Design Mode. The Events right-click menu lists all the Events for the form. Only the Events that appear selected and in bold type have already been defined. For more information, see Attaching Scripts to Events.</p>

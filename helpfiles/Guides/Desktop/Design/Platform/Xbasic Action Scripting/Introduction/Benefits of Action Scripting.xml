        <p>Action Scripting allows you to "program" in a menu driven environment. You respond to the prompts presented to you, and then, behind the scenes, Alpha Anywhere translates your responses into the appropriate Xbasic code.</p>
        <p>Once you have created an Action in an Action Script, you can always go back and edit the Action in the same prompted environment.</p>
        <p>For those who want to eventually learn Xbasic, Action Scripting is an ideal starting point. For each Action you create, you can view the corresponding Xbasic code. The code is extensively commented, so it is easy to understand.</p>
        <p>Even experienced Xbasic programmers will often use Action Scripting to quickly generate error-free code, which can then be hand modified. You create Action Scripts in the Alpha Anywhere Code Editor.</p>

    <description>The scripts we've been working with so far are not associated with any particular "events." To run the "Lesson1" script, you double-click it in the Control Panel. This script is called a Global Script because it can be run at any time.</description>

                <p>Some of the examples in this guide require the "Learning Action Scripting" workspace. See [Creating Your First Action Script] to learn how to get the "Learning Action Scripting" workspace installed.</p>

                <p>However, consider this scenario: You create a form and put a button on it. When the user clicks the button, you would like a script to run. When the user clicks the button, the button's OnClick event fires. Alpha Anywhere lets you automatically run a script whenever an event is fired. A script that runs when an event occurs is called an Event Script.</p>
                <p>You can attach scripts to a variety of events. For example, a form's OnSave event fires when a record is saved, or its OnActivate event fires when the form receives focus. Refer to Field Rule Field Events and Field Rule Record Events for a full list of events.</p>
                <p>In this lesson you are going to focus on the most common event, a button's OnPush event.</p>

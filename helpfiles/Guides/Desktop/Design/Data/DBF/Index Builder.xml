			<title>Repairing an Index</title>
			<description>
				<p>Certain events can corrupt your indexes; for example, if you improperly exit Alpha Anywhere, such as turning off your computer while Alpha Five is running, or if a power failure occurs while Alpha Anywhere is updating an index.</p>
				<p>When an index becomes corrupted, you might notice that records do not appear as expected. For example, a record that you can see in the Default Browse, viewed in record number order, does not appear on a report.</p>
				<p>Some database problems can be traced to corrupted or out-to-date indexes. If you have any doubt about the integrity of your indexes, you should update them manually.</p>

	<description>Alpha Anywhere provides a variety of ways to order and select data to view, print, or use in data-processing operations. One of the easiest ways to select records and sort them is by using Query by Form, which lets you enter search and sort criteria in the same form you use for entering data. Refer to Sorting and Selecting Overview.

	<description>Alpha Anywhere lets you add images to your database in two ways.</description>
	
<sections>
<section><cases>
		<case>
			<title>Bitmap and JPEG Image fields</title>
			<description>store Windows Bitmap (.BMP) or JPEG (.JPG) images in the database. The images are stored in .FPT memo files.</description>
		</case>
		<case>
			<title>Image File Reference fields</title>
			<description>store the paths and filenames of Windows Bitmap (.BMP) or JPEG (.JPG) images in the database, while the images are stored independently in Windows folders. For many applications this is a more efficient way of storing images, and it can result in much smaller databases.</description>

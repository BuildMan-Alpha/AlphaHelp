	<topic>Creating and Using Calculated Values</topic>
	<description>Use calculated values to automatically calculated a number, character string, or any other variable type when you enter or change data. The developer may manually enter the expression that calculates a value or use the Expression Builder. The operator cannot enter or change data in a calculated value.</description>

<section>
	<note>Alpha Anywhere documentation and software has traditionally referred the values that you calculate and place on a layout as "calculated fields". However, these values are not fields, because they are not stored in a table record. They are temporary variables that are created and calculated on demand.</note>

	<title>Expressions
</title>
	<description>The Invoice form of the AlphaSports database has four calculated values: amt_disc, amt_tax, and grand_total. The calculated values have the following expressions.
</description>
<cases>
	<case>
		<title>total</title>
		<description>Sum the INVOICE_ITEMS->Extension and GRP  >INVOICE_HEADER fields.</description>
		<example><![CDATA[total(INVOICE_ITEMS  >Extension, 
GRP >INVOICE_HEADER)]]></example>
	</case>
	<case>
		<title>amt_disc</title>
		<description>Multiply the CALC->TOTAL field by the Discount and divide by 100.
</description>
		<example><![CDATA[CALC->TOTAL * 
Discount/100]]></example>
	</case>
	<case>
		<title>amt_tax</title>
		<description>Subtract the Calc->amt_disc field from the Calc->Total field, multiply by the Sales_Tax field, and divide by 100.</description>
		<example><![CDATA[(Calc->Total - Calc->amt_disc) * 
Sales_Tax / 100]]></example>
	</case>
	<case>
		<title>grand_total</title>
		<description>Subtract the Calc->Amt_Disc field from the Calc->Total field, then add the Calc->Amt_Tax field.</description>
		<example><![CDATA[Calc->Total - 
Calc->Amt_Disc + Calc->Amt_Tax ]]></example>
	</case>

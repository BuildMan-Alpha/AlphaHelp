			<title>.MUF</title>
			<description>Alpha Anywhere creates temporary .MUF files to control the number of people who can concurrently open a database. If a user has a 3 user a5 license, then: when person 1 opens the database, the .MUF file with the same name as the .ADB file is created and a count of 1 is recorded in the .MUF file. When person 2 opens, the count in the .MUF file is increased to 2. When person 3 opens, the count in the .MUF file is increased to 3. When person 4 tries to open the count in the .MUF file would exceed the number of licenses, so person 4 gets an error message. When person 3 closes, the count in the .MUF file is reduced to 2 and person 4 could open. When all users close the count in the MUF file is 0 and the .MUF file is deleted by Alpha Anywhere. If a crash occurs the .MUF file may be left on disk, preventing other users from accessing the application. In this case all users should exit Alpha Anywhere and the MUF should be manually deleted.</description>

		<case>
			<title>.RMUF</title>
			<description>The Alpha Anywhere Runtime keeps track of the number of simultaneous users using a file with a .RMUF extension, which has the same functionality as a .MUF file.</description>

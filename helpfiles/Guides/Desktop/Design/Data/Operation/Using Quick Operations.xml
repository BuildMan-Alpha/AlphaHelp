	<topic>Using Quick Operations</topic>
	<description>Often, when you are viewing records in form or browse view, you would like to do a quick Operation on the data (such as Update the value in a selected field in the records that are currently selected), or copy the selected records to a new table, or move the selected records to a new table. You have no need to save the Operation definition for future use. In these cases, the ad-hoc, quick Operations are ideal because they generally involve far fewer steps than defining a new saved Operation.
When viewing records in a form or Browse, you can use the Records menu for quick access to the following ad-hoc Operations.

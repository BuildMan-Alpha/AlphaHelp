	<topic>Using Operation Builders</topic>
	<description>If you prefer not to use one of Alpha Anywhere's Genies for performing an operation, you can define the operation yourself using the appropriate Operation Builder (e.g. the Copy Builder or the Export Builder ). The following section describes how to perform operations using the different Operation Cards. You define the operation by filling in the Card.

<note>Even if you prefer to work with an Operation Builder directly, the Operation Genies are still useful because they can be used to fill in the Builder for you. You can then edit the settings in the Builder that were entered by the Genie.</note>

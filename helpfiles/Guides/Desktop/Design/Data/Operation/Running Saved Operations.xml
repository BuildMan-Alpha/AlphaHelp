		<description>You cannot run a saved operation directly from an A5W page or web component. However, you can copy the Xbasic code from an operation and place it into a script in an A5W page.</description>
<steps>
	<step>
		<description>Right click on the operation in the Control Panel and select view Xbasic.</description>
	</step>
	<step>
		<description>Copy this Xbasic and paste it into a page script.</description>
	</step>
	<step>
		<description>Remove any code that would display a user interface (e.g. a message box), since that will cause the server to hang.</description>

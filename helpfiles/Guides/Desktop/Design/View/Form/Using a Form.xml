</description>
<cases>

</description>
		<cases>

			</case>
			
		</cases>
	</case>

Also, you can only undo changes to a field while the cursor remains in the field. Once you move your cursor to a different field, the Undo operation won't work.
However, as long as you are still viewing the same record, clicking the Cancel Changes button (or ESCAPE ) will undo all changes to the record.

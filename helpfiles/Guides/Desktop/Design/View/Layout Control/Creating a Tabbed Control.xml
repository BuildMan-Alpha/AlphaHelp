	<description>Tabbed controls provide a familiar, tabbed interface that you can use on a form to organize fields, controls, and other objects. For example, you have a form in which you enter invoice information. By creating a tabbed control, you can have one tabbed page on which you fill in customer information, one page on which you enter billing information, and a third page on which you enter individual line-items.

	<description>To create a tabbed control, you use the Tabbed Control tool on the Toolbox. Once the object has been created, you can set the names that appear on the tab labels as well as other properties. Lastly, you can drag fields, text, and other objects onto each tabbed page.

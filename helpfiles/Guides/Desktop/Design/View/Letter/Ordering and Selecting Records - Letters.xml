	<description>There are two ways to specify the records to print and the order in which they print. You can either save the criteria in the Letter layout, or prompt the user for the criteria at print time. These options are not mutually exclusive, so you can choose to save order and selection criteria, and then make changes to the criteria just before the Letter prints.

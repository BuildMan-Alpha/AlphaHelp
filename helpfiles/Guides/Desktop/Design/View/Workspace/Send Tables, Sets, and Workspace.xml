            <description>When you send a table, set, or workspace, you have the option of sending the data files only, the dictionary files only, or both. This is very useful if you want to update someone else's application without overwriting any of their data. For example, if you made some changes to the "Customer Information" form for the "Customer" table and you want to send the new version of the form to your client, without overwriting any of the data he has entered into the customer table, you can send the customer table data dictionary files only.

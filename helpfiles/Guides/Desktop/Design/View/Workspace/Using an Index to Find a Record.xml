    <topic>Using an Index to Find a Record</topic>
    <description>The following script is provides a simple example of how to use an index to determine whether a record exists, and to act accordingly. To start, we create an index based on lastname and firstname named "LF". The Order Expression for the index is alltrim(lastname) + "," + alltrim(firstname). </description>

                <p>After opening the Customer table, the script uses &lt;tbl&gt;.INDEX_PRIMARY_PUT() to set "LF" as the current index.</p>
                <p>The script then displays an Xdialog that asks for firstname, lastname, and phone number. It composes a key based on firstname and lastname and uses &lt;tbl&gt;.FETCH_FIND() to find the first matching record.</p>
                <p>If that record does not exist, as indicated by a negative recnum, the script uses &lt;tbl&gt;.ENTER_BEGIN() to add a new record. If the record does exist, the script uses &lt;tbl&gt;.FETCH_GOTO() to move to and then &lt;tbl&gt;.CHANGE_BEGIN() to modify the phone number field in the record.</p>

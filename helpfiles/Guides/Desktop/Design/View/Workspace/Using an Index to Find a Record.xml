	<topic>Using an Index to Find a Record</topic>
	<description>The following script is provides a simple example of how to use an index to determine whether a record exists, and to act accordingly. To start, we create an index based on lastname and firstname named "LF". The Order Expression for the index is alltrim(lastname) + "," + alltrim(firstname). </description>

	<description><![CDATA[After opening the Customer table, the script uses <TBL>.INDEX_PRIMARY_PUT() to set "LF" as the current index.
The script then displays an Xdialog that asks for firstname, lastname, and phone number. It composes a key based on firstname and lastname and uses <TBL>.FETCH_FIND() to find the first matching record.
If that record does not exist, as indicated by a negative recnum, the script uses <TBL>.ENTER_BEGIN() to add a new record. If the record does exist, the script uses <TBL>.FETCH_GOTO() to move to and then <TBL>.CHANGE_BEGIN() to modify the phone number field in the record.

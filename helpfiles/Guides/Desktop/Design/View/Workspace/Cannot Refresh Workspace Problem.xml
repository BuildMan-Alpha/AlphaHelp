	<topic>Cannot Refresh Workspace Problem</topic>
	<description>When Alpha Anywhere is refreshing a shadow workspace, it creates a file named after your database (.ADB file) by appending "LOCK" to the filename. </description>

			<description>
				<p>For example, if your workspace was named INVOICE.ADB, Alpha Anywhere would create INVOICE.ADBLOCK. The reason is to prevent more than one user from refreshing the workspace at the same time. When the refresh is complete, Alpha Anywhere removes the file.</p>
				<p>However, if someone starts the process and does not finish it, Alpha Anywhere may not erase the file. The result is that you get the incorrect message that someone else is refreshing.</p>
				<p>The solution is to delete the .ADBLOCK file (not the .ADB file).</p>

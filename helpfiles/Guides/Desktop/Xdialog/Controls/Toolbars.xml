Alpha Anywhere includes a variety of System Toolbars. To better suit your needs, you can modify the system toolbars by adding and removing buttons, or create your own custom toolbars and save them in the database.</description>

To find out what a particular Toolbar button does, move the cursor over the button. A Bubble Help description of the button appears.

	<title>Writing a Clock Control</title>
	<cases>
		<case>
			<note>This example is contained in the form called "Clock" in the Samples\Xbasic directory. This control is implemented using a User Defined Control. It makes use of a lot of GDI functions as well as the timer event.</note>
		</case>
		<case>
			<title>OnCreate Event</title>
	<description>The OnCreate event fires when the window for the control is created. The SetTimer call is a windows API call that is declared in the OnInit event.
When the window is created, we add a timer to that window which goes off every 1, 000 milliseconds (that is once a second) - the ID that we give is is ?1' - the ?0' that is the last parameter is a NULL callback function. Currently, callback functions are not supported by XBASIC.
</description>
	<example><![CDATA[' when window is created, create a timer that goes off every second
timer_id = SetTimer(a_USER.hwnd, 1, 1000, 0) ]]></example>
			
		</case>
		<case>
			<title>OnDestroy Event</title>
	<description>The OnDestroy event fires when the window for the control is destroyed. The KillTimer call is also a windows API call (declared in the OnInit event). When we destroy the window for the control, we must also destroy the associated timer.</description>
	<example><![CDATA[' when the window is destroyed, throw the timer away
KillTimer( a_USER.hwnd , timer_id ) ]]></example>

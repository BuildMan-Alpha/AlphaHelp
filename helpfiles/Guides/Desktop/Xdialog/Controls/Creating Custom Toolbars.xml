<description>Alpha Anywhere lets you create your own toolbars. You can attach custom toolbars to forms, browses, and print preview windows. Unlike custom menus, however, you do not need a form, browse, or print preview window to use a custom toolbars. You can run a custom toolbar from the control panel, or from an Xbasic script, and the toolbar will remain open until you close it.</description>

Like custom menus, the buttons on custom toolbars can execute built-in actions, such as the Next command on the Records menu, they can play Global Scripts, or they can execute embedded Xbasic commands.

	<title>Designing a Custom Toolbar vs Customizing a System Toolbar
</title>
	<description>Alpha Anywhere allows you to customize the system toolbars that are displayed with the various windows in Alpha Anywhere. For example, when you are viewing a form, Alpha Anywhere displays a standard Form toolbar. You can customize this toolbar by right clicking on it and selecting Customize. Your options, however, are limited to removing buttons, or adding buttons that perform built in actions.
You cannot put a button on this system toolbar that plays a script. If you want to put user defined buttons on a toolbar that play scripts, you must create a custom toolbar as Described above.

	<description>The memo field is named Notes. The Notes.activate() statement activates the memo control, because it loses focus when you click the Copy button. The ptr = ui_editor_get() statement gets a pointer to the editor associated with the memo control. The ptr.copy()statement copies the current selection of text into the clipboard. The last 2 lines of the script retrieve the text from the clipboard and paste it into the lastname field of the form.

dim ptr as P
Notes.activate()
ptr = ui_editor_get()
ptr.copy()
name = clipboard.Get_Data()
lastname.text = name ]]></example>

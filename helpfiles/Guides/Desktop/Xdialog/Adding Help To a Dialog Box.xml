	<topic>Adding Help To a Dialog Box</topic>
<description>You can add pop-up help to a dialog box using the {Help} command.
The pop-up help is accessed from a standard Windows help file (.hlp or .chm). You need a third party product, such as RoboHelp? to create Windows help files. The pop-up help is displayed when the user presses the F1 key. The pop-up help can also be displayed when the user presses a button on your dialog.

	<topic>Address Dialog - Adding Blank Lines</topic>
	<description>To space out the vertical distance between controls on an Xdialog, you can insert blank lines using the '{lf};' command. This is analogous to pressing Enter on a blank line in a word processor to leave extra space between paragraphs.

		<note>It is important that the {lf}; command include the terminating ';' character. This is because Xdialog does not normally allocate any space to blank rows or cells. A blank row that is terminated with a ';' will not take up any space on the dialog. However, the {lf} command instructs Alpha Anywhere to allocate the standard line height to the blank line.</note>

	<topic>Controlling the Font of Static Text</topic>
<description>You can set the font of static text on a dialog using the {font=} command. After changing the font, the size of a character column changes to the new font's representation of a column.
The syntax of the {font=} command is:

	<note>Multiple {font=} commands can be used in a dialog, and the font of any static text on the dialog is controlled by the most recent {font=} command in the script. However, you cannot change the font within a static text object (for example, changing from Arial to Times Roman). If you try to change the font within a static text object, by including a {font=} command within the static text, Alpha Anywhere will actually begin a new static text object when it encounters the next {font=} command. This will not give you the effect that you want. To change the font within a text object, you need to use Rich Text Font (RTF) objects, which we will discuss later.</note>

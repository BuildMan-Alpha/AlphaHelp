	<topic>Using the KillFocus Event</topic>
<description>The following script prompts the user for their name. It automatically capitalizes the first character of the name, and puts the rest of the name in lower case when the user exits from the control. It also formats the telephone number. When the user exits a control the killfocus event is generated. The event handling code for this script traps the killfocus event, and formats the text in the text box:</description>

				<p>When you save a report in the Crystal Reports designer, the file you save has a .rpt extension. The saved report file can include a snapshot of the data. If so, then it is not necessary to connect to the original data source to print the report (because the data is already present in the .rpt file).</p>
				<p>Alternatively, you can reconnect to your data source at print time and refresh the data used in the report. Two examples are shown below. In the first we simply print preview the report using the saved data that is stored in the report.</p>
				<p>This example prints a sample Crystal Report file that ships with Crystal Reports.</p>
				<p>Since the .rpt file contains saved data we do not need to connect to the data source.</p>

			<description>This next example runs a report that was built against the sample Alphasports.mdb file that ships with Alpha Anywhere (see the MDBFiles folder in the a5V12 program folder). This script connects to the alphasports.mdb file and refreshes the data before the report is printed.</description>

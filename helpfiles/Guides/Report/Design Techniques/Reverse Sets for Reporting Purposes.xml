	<topic>Reverse Sets for Reporting Purposes
</topic>
<description>Reverse sets are any easy to use and powerful solution to getting at your data. If is often necessary to "drill-down" and filter records based on data in a child table of a one-to-many set. Although this is certainly doable from the one-to-many set structure, it is easier and sometimes a clearer approach to query the data from a reverse set.</description>

Remember that a set is nothing more than a definition of how two or more tables are related. as such a set adds little or nothing in terms of overhead. A small amount of disk space will be used to hold the definition of a set, and Alpha Anywhere will create, if one does not already exist, an index based on the child table linking value. Because of this, it is desirable to consider creating sets for the special data reporting needs that you might have.

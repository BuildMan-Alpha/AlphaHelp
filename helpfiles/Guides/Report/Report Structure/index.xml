	<description>Alpha Anywhere Reports are divided into sections, of which there are three types:</description>
	<groups>
		<group>
			<title>Report Sections</title>
			<sections>
				<section>
					<title>Report section : </title>
					<description>prints at the beginning and end of the report. The Report section acts as a wrapper for the rest of the Report.</description>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Detail section :</title>
					<description>prints individual records, and repeats until all records have been printed.</description>	
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Grouping levels :</title>
					<description>groups related records together. Grouping levels are sections that you create. They repeat for each group of records. </description>

						<p>Within each of these sections, you can have multiple header and footer layout edit regions. Edit regions are where the fields, text, and other objects are placed. The edit regions you use in your Report vary depending on your needs.</p>
						<p>Before jumping in and creating a report, it is helpful to first become familiar with the Report Editor. The Report Editor shows the division between sections and edit regions by using dark gray section-title bars and light gray edit region-title bars.</p>
						<p>On each of these bars is an outline button which allows you to show or hide edit regions. Clicking the button when it displays the minus symbol (-) hides the edit regions, while clicking the outline button while it displays the plus symbol (+) shows the edit regions. Clicking an outline button on a particular edit region-title bar shows or hides that edit region. Clicking an outline button on a particular section-title bar shows or hides all of the edit regions contained in that section.</p>
						<p>These buttons only affect what displays in the Report Editor, they do affect the appearance of the report when it is printed or previewed. You can also display and hide report components by choosing View > Sections, View > Titles, or View > Regions. as you work with the editor, you will find these options helpful in reducing the amount of clutter you see on the screen.</p>

			<title>Report Layout Regions</title>
			<sections>
				<section>
					<description>The following sections describe where and when report layout regions appear. A spillover page occurs when the detail section of a group begins on one page and ends on another.</description>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Report Header</title>

				</section>
				<section>

				</section>

				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Page Footer</title>

				</section>
				<section>

			<title>The Report Section</title>
			<sections>
				<section>
					<description>The Report section is the outermost section of a report. It can have a Report Header and/or Report Footer edit region. The Report Header is the first region to print; the Report Footer is the last. The Report Header typically contains general information about the report, such as its title; the Report Footer contains summary information for the report, such as totals: </description>

			<title>The Detail Section</title>
			<sections>
				<section>
					<description>When you run a report, each edit region prints sequentially from top to bottom until the Detail region is reached. The fields and objects placed in the Detail region then print repeatedly for each record in the report, until the report either runs out of records, or a group break occurs (explained in the section Grouping Related Records later in this chapter). After all the records are printed, all of the edit regions below the Detail region are printed sequentially: </description>

				</section>
				<section>
					<description>Along with the Detail region, the Detail section can also contain a Detail Header and a Detail Footer. These edit regions appear before and after the Detail region. Typically, the Detail Header is used to display column titles for fields listed in the Detail region, and the Detail Footer is used to print summary information about the Detail region data. On any page that records from the Detail edit region print, the Detail Header and Detail Footer edit regions appear (provided you have created them).</description>

					<title>Expanding the Detail Section</title>
					<description>You may expand the Detail section vertically to place multiple fields above or below each other. In the first picture, note how the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow when it is above a boundary that can be moved. </description>

			<title>Edit Regions</title>
			<sections>
				<section>
					<description>Fields, text, and other objects are placed in the edit regions of the report in the same way as they are placed on forms.When placing fields and objects into an edit region, often it is helpful to adjust the edit region's size. This can be done using the mouse. Move the mouse to the lower edit region-title bar. When the cursor-shape changes to a double arrow, you can click and drag the edit region up or down to make it smaller or bigger. </description>

				</section>
				<section>
					<description>To prevent too much space from being wasted when the report prints, make the edit region as small as Possible. Some objects, such as Rich Text Objects, Rich Text Fields, and Memo Fields can automatically expand when they are printed, and frames placed around these objects can automatically expand as well.</description>

	<topic>Filtering, Printing, and Emailing a Report
</topic>
		<description>This topic describes how to create a dialog component that accepts an email address, start date, and end date, uses the dates to create a filter, prints the filtered report to a PDF file, and then emails the PDF file.

		<title>Create the Dialog
</title>
		<steps>
			<step>
				<description>The first step is to create a dialog component with a TextBox control named email_address and two Calendar controls named from_date and to_date.
</description>
			</step>
			<step>
				<description>Place this control on a page. In this example I used the HTML Editor to add a heading above the component. Your component might look like this.

			</step>
			<step>
				<description>The next step is to display the component's Form > Properties page.
</description>
			</step>
			<step>
				<description>Click the '...' button in the Server Events > AfterValidate property to display the Form Events dialog. Enter the script (without the intervening comments).

		<description>This section of the script uses EVAL_VALID() to check that email_address, from_date, and to_date have values. If any them do not have a value, the script exits by jumping to skip_report: .
</description>
		<example><![CDATA[IF eval_valid("email_address") = .f. Then

goto skip_report
end if
IF eval_valid("from_date") = .f. Then

goto skip_report
end if
if eval_valid("to_date") = .f. Then

goto skip_report
end if ]]></example>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<description>Next, the script checks that from_date and to_date have meaningful values. Note, while from_date and to_date are defined as date variables on the dialog, they return character values.
</description>
		<example><![CDATA[if (from_date = "") then
    from_date = dtoc( date() )
end if
if (to_date = "") then
    to_date = dtoc( date() )
end if
if ( ctod(from_date) > ctod(to_date) ) then

goto skip_report
end if ]]></example>
	</section>

		<description>This section of the script generates a report containing the records selected by from_date and to_date. It saves the report to a temporary file in a session folder. Note, the Application Server automatically creates the session folder and then deletes the folder and its contents when your session ends. Also note how the filter expression converts the character date values into proper date values using CTOD() and then quotes them using S_QUOTE().
</description>
		<example><![CDATA[dim filter as C
dim order as C
dim filename as C
dim message as P
filter = "invoice_header->date >= " + s_quote( ctod(from_date) ) + " .and. invoice_header->date <= " + s_quote( ctod(to_date) )
order = "invoice_header->date"
filename = session.session_folder + "tempreport.pdf"
filename = report.saveas("Invoice", "pdf", filter, order, filename, .f.) ]]></example>

		<description>This section of the script sends the report created above. Note, the use of EMAIL_SEND2(), which is appropriate for use in web applications. The message dot variable has many optional parameters, but this code sample illustrates the minimum required.
</description>
		<example><![CDATA[message.to = email_address
message.from = "alpha@alphasoftware.com"
message.subject = "Invoice Report for " + to_date + " to " + from_date
message.Attachments = filename
message.message = "Invoice report is attached"
email_send2(message, "Default")
skip_report: ]]></example>
<note><![CDATA[The second parameter of the EMAIL_SEND2() function references a profile named "Default". This is the actual name of a profile defined by going to View > Settings > Email and defining and saving a profile. This profile does not assume that you are using the Alpha Five email client. Rather, it defines the information needed to connect with your email server and send a message without user interaction.]]></note>

                        <p>If you have images stored in a table as blob data, an image file reference, ink, or svg, you can display them in a report by overriding the Field Definition for the field.</p>
                        <p>In the *[Specify Data Source]* dialog, click on *[Advanced Options]* near the bottom of the dialog. On the Advanced Options dialog check *[Override field definitions of selected fields]* and press the *[Field Definitions]* button. In the Field Definitions dialog, select the image field and click the *[Edit field definition]* button. Select the desired type from the *[Data type]* dropdown. Supported data types for images are listed below:</p>

                    <description>
                        <p>Base64 images stored in a text field can be rendered as images in reports. You can do this by changing the field definition for the field from a character type to the appropriate image type: *[ui:Bitmap]*, *[ui:Jpeg Image]*, or *[ui:PNG Image]*.</p>
                        <p>You can alternatively use an HTML object to embed the image into the report. Add a static HTML object to the report. Click the [edit] Edit button in the upper right-hand corner of the HTML object to edit the HTML.</p>

                        <p>In the HTML editor, add an <![CDATA[<img>]]> tag to the HTML source and set the src property to the field. For example, suppose you have a field in your database that contains a base64 encoded png image called "Base64Image":</p>

                    <description>
                        <p>Images can be annotated with Ink. The annotation is stored separately from the image. In order to display the image with annotations in the report, the two fields need to be combined into a composite image. The *[link:a5_composite_picture_and_ink@../../Ref/Api/Functions/Printable Layouts/Report Functions/a5_composite_picture_and_ink Function.xml]* Xbasic method can be used to create a composite image. The composite image can be stored in a calculated field, which can be placed in the Report.</p>

                        <p>The Signature Capture control in Alpha Anywhere captures and saves the signature as a PNG image. To display a Signature in a Report, override the field definition for the Signature field and set the Data type to *[ui:PNG Image]*.</p>

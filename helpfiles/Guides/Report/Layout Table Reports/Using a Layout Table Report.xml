</title>
	<description>Layout Table Reports can be previewed, printed, saved, e-mailed, and faxed in any of five formats: PDF, HTML, Rich Text, Plain Text, and Excel. What distinguishes Layout Table Reports from Free Form Reports is the tabular layout that lends itself to high-fidelity rendering as HTML tables and Excel spreadsheets.

                <p>When an entry in the bookmarks section is clicked, the corresponding page where the object is located is shown and the focus is given to the defined *[ui:Target object]*.</p>

                <title>Reports - Table of Contents, Bookmarks and Index</title>
                <description>
                    <p>A Table of Contents, Bookmarks, or Index can be added to a report using the report builder. You can completely customize the entries that are made in the Table of Contents, Bookmark section, and Index. In addition, you can completely customize the layout of the Table of Contents section and Index section.</p>
                    <p>The entries that appear in the Table of Contents, Bookmark section, and Index are "live" - if you click on an entry, you will be navigated to the appropriate page in the report. In addition, when you print the report to a PDF file, the Table of Contents, Bookmarks, and Index are live.</p>

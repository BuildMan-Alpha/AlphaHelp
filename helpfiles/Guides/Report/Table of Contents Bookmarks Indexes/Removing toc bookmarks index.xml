                <p>To delete a section, uncheck the checkbox for the section you want to remove. This will delete the section from the report. For example, in the image above, unchecking *[ui:Has Index]* will delete the index from the report.</p>
                <p>If the report does not contain bookmarks, a table of contents, or an index, the checkbox for the section will be disabled. If none of these sections are in the report, you will be shown a message that there are no bookmarks, table of contents, or index entries in the report.</p>

        <p>A custom index can be created for a report, listing key terms and page numbers for the report. The index is also 'live', meaning the user can click on an entry to navigate to the corresponding page in the report.</p>
    </description>
    <discussion>
        <p>The index appears after the report body and lists the page number for each entry. Entries are fully customizable as is the appearance of the index.</p>

                <p>Every time a record in a report section is printed, the *[ui:Index entry expression]* is evaluated and a new entry is inserted into the index. The text shown in the index is the result of the expression.</p>

            <description>
                <p>The layout of the index can be customized by creating a special type of report called an *[ui:Index Report]*. The custom *[ui:Index Report]* is built using the report builder. Any formatting or styling tools available in the report builder can be used to customize the appearance of the index.</p>
                <p>To create a customized index, click the *[ui:Add new custom 'Index' Report]* link at the bottom of the *[ui:Define Index for Report]* dialog. When prompted, specify a name for the new *[ui:Index Report]* and click *[ui:OK]*. Alpha Anywhere will open the report builder, which can be used to customize the index. When you are satisfied with your changes, save and close the report.</p>

                <p>When you create an Index Report, you can store it in one of two locations:</p>
            </description>
            <list>
                <item>
                    <name-title>Location</name-title>

                <item>
                    <name>Global Dictionary</name>
                    <description>The Index Report will be saved in the global report dictionary.</description>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>Local Dictionary</name>
                    <description>The Index Report will be saved in a local report dictionary (required for web applications)</description>
                </item>
            </list>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p>If the Index Report is stored in the global dictionary, it can be used in other reports that you have created.</p>
                <p>If stored in a local dictionary, the index can only be referenced by the report used to create it.</p>
                <p>If a report will be used in a web application, the Index Report must be stored in a local dictionary. Desktop applications support storing Index Reports in both local and global dictionaries.</p>

                <title>Reports - Table of Contents, Bookmarks and Index</title>
                <description>
                    <p>A Table of Contents, Bookmarks, or Index can be added to a report using the report builder. You can completely customize the entries that are made in the Table of Contents, Bookmark section, and Index. In addition, you can completely customize the layout of the Table of Contents section and Index section.</p>
                    <p>The entries that appear in the Table of Contents, Bookmark section, and Index are "live" - if you click on an entry, you will be navigated to the appropriate page in the report. In addition, when you print the report to a PDF file, the Table of Contents, Bookmarks, and Index are live.</p>
                </description>
                <note>This feature was originally sold as an optional add-on in Alpha Five Version 10 but is now included in all versions of Alpha Anywhere.</note>

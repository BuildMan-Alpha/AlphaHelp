<h3><a id="UnderstandingAlerts">Understanding Alerts</a></h3>
<p>
When something significant happens in the cloud, and event is logged.
Some of those events affect your subscription.</p><br/>
<ul>
<li><p>You can create an alert for events, such as a month-to-date cost overage or a projected overage for the month, requesting that you be notified when and if the event occurs.
	</p><br/></li>
<li><p>Some events include quantities; such as the US dollar amount of an overage.  
	For those events, you can set a threshold using an operator and a constant value indicating that you only want to be notified if the event satisfies the constraint you specify.
	</p><br/></li>
<li><p>Alpha Cloud will send an e-mail to each recipient you designate for the alert you create each time the alert occurs.
	</p><br/></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Certain events, such as overages and projected overages, can be reported once per day.  An overage may continue to be reported once each day for the remainder of the month it occurs in.</p>

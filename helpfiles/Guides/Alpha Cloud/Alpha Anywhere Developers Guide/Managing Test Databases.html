<h3><a id="Why">Why shouldn't I use Alpha Cloud test databases in production?</a></h3>

<p>Alpha Cloud test databases are included with your subscription to simplify getting started with development.  
As such, we do not recommend or support using them in production.  We do recommend using a Database as a Service product such as Amazon AWS Relational Database Services (RDS) as these products offer a number of important facilities not found in Alpha Cloud test databases.
</p>
<p>Limitations of Alpha Cloud Test Databases:
<ul>
<li><strong>Security </strong>- TLS connections are not supported.  Alpha Cloud test databases use SSH tunneling to create a secure channel to our cluster, but within the cluster, TLS is not implemented.  Your production database should support secure connections all the way to the database server that encrypt data in transit.</li>
<li><strong>Latency </strong> - All test databases are currently deployed in Amazon region US-East-1 (Virginia).  If you are deploying to a different region, you will experience delays in queries due to the geographic distance between your deployment and the test database.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> - Alpha Cloud test databases are deployed on a limited CPU and memory configuration .  A production  database often requires larger instances.</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong> - Alpha Cloud test databases are deployed as a single replica in a Kubernetes cluster.  For maximum availability, a production database requires multiple instances in multiple data centers.</li>
<li><strong>Recoverability</strong> - Alpha Cloud test databases may be backed up manually using the available dialogs, but there is no automated backup.  Production systems should be backed up automatically and frequently and need to be restorable using point-in-time recovery.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Because Alpha Cloud test databases are currently deployed in Virginia, USA, storing customer data there may be in violation of privacy rules and regulations for the country of their residence.  Production systems must honor the appropriate locality rules for customer data. Test databases should never contain private customer data and should never contain credit card information!</li>
</ul>
<br/>
</p>

<h3><a id="AboutTestDatabases">About Test Databases</a></h3>

<p>Your Alpha Cloud subscription includes one or more test database servers.
As of this writing, you can create one server of each of the following databases:
<ul>
<li>MariaDB</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>SQL Server</li>
</ul>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
You can create multiple databases on each database server.
Space is limited, and the databases are for use in testing only.
</p>
<br/>

<p>
As test servers and databases, the following restrictions apply:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Space is limited. Currently each server is provisioned with 1GB of space for databases.</li>
<li>Server performance is limited and does not scale.</li>
<li>You can make your own backups and restore data using the Alpha Cloud dialogs, but there is no automated backup or recovery.</li>
<li>There is reasonable, but minimal security. Data is not encrypted either in transit or at rest.<br/><br/>
<strong>Note: </strong> Storing confidential data on these servers may be a violation of local law.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br/>

<p><strong>Important: </strong>To manage your test databases you must have Subscription level permissions. 
Connecting to your database requires only a username and password with appropriate access permission.
</p>
<br/>

<h4><a id="TestDatabaseImplementation">Test Servers and Databases - Implementation Details</a></h4>
<p>As of this writing Alpha Cloud Test Database Servers are run on a Kubernetes cluster on the Google Cloud.
Each server is run as a separate Docker container instance with fixed memory and CPU constraints.
We have found Kubernetes to be a very responsive orchestration environment for small servers.
We chose the Google (GKE) cluster because it had a very well thought out management interface, 
and because Google is the original developer of Kubernetes.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Access to your test database is provided through an SSH2 tunnel. 
We chose this approach because it greatly simplifies management of public IP addresses and DNS names and limits direct connections from unsecured clients. 
You can access your test databases using the SSH connection feature that is built into Alpha Anywhere Data Access Objects.
Connections to your test databases can be established from your development environment, from Alpha Cloud, and using third-party tools, as discussed below.
</p>

<h3><a id="BackUpDatabase">Backing Up a Test Database</a></h3>
<p>
Any of your test databases can be backed up to a file on your development computer.
Backups are done with the native backup facility of the database server.
The format of the file will depend on the database type you are backing up.<br/><br/>
<strong>Note: </strong>
<ul>
<li>MariaDB databases will be backed up to a SQL script in text format.</li>
<li>PostgreSQL databases will be backed up in compressed format, making them quite compact.</li>
<li>SQL Server databases will be backed up in a BAK file format. SQL Server Express is used for test databases and does not support compression.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Important: </strong>All data in the local file your select will be replaced during the backup process.
</p>

</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<h3><a id="RestoreDatabase">Restoring To a Test Database</a></h3>
<p>
Any of your test databases can be restored from a file on your development computer.
Backups must have been created using the native backup facility of the database server you are restoring data from.
The format of the file will depend on the database type you are backing up and must be something the native restore command recognizes.<br/><br/>
<strong>Note: </strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>MariaDB </strong>databases can be backed up to a SQL script in text format using MySQLDump or another tool.</li>
<li><strong>PostgreSQL </strong>databases can be backed up in compressed format, making them quite compact, using the pg_dump utility or an interactive tool.</li>
<li><strong>SQL Server </strong>databases should be backed up in a BAK file format. SQL Server Express is used for test databases and does not support compression, but the restore can read such a file. You can use the sqlcmd utility or the management user interface.<br/><br/>
	<strong>Important: </strong>SQL Server data is stored in named logical files.  For your data to restore properly you need to back it up from a database that has a single data file and a log file.  
Alpha Cloud will restore and rename the logical files to match the target database so that future backups and restores work properly.
If you have additional logical files in your backup, they will not be remapped and your database may not behave properly initially or after a backup and restore.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Important: </strong>All data on the target database will be deleted during the restore process.
Existing data cannot be restored later.
If you are restoring to an existing database, be sure you have backed up any data you wish to keep.
</p>
<br/>

<p>To restore data to a new or existing database:<br/>

<ol>
	<li>Open the Managing Test Databases dialog as shown in 
		<a href="#ManagingTestDatabases">Managing Test Servers and Databases</a>
		</li>
	<li>Select one or more database servers by clicking the checkbox to the left of each server, or select all of them

			with an alphabetic character.</li><br/>
	<li><strong>For SQL Server Only: </strong>If your are restoring from a database with a different name, be sure
			to provide the name of that database in the Source Database text box.  
		This information is used to remap the logical files for the data and the log during the 
			restore process.<br/><br/>
		As discussed above, backups with additional or custom logical files require additional logic to remap.  
		To restore these databases as test databases you must use the SQL Server commands or tools to convert
			the logical files to the default data and log only.  See the SQL Server documentation for 
			more information.
		</li><br/>
	<li>Enter the name of the source file that contains the backup file that you want to restore from into

<h3><a id="SSHTunnels">Accessing Your Test Database from Third Party Tools</a></h3>
<p>
All connections to test databases are made using an SSH2 tunnel.  A tunnel provides a network path to a resource inside of another computing environment without exposing the resource to the internet directly.  As discussed above, Alpha Cloud Test Databases use SSH2 tunnels to make management of clustered servers simpler.  Although tunneling may seem intimidating at first, Alpha Anywhere manages the complexity for you where possible.
</p>
<p>
Once you have created connection strings to access your test database, Alpha Anywhere and your web project 
can connect to the database using those connection strings and will automatically open a tunnel as needed.
Because opening a tunnel is an expensive operation time-wise, the tunnel is held open as long as the development environment or a application server is running.
</p>
</p>
<p>You can make your database available to third party tools on the developer machine by opening an SSH2 tunnel from within Alpha Anywhere and providing the appropriate credentials to that tool.  A tunnel makes your database appear to be local to the development machine.  You will connect to "localhost" using a port that Alpha Anywhere assigns.  This section will discuss how to open a tunnel for a database and how to provide a tool access to your database.
</p>
<p><strong>Important: </strong>Alpha Anywhere must be running to keep a tunnel open for other programs. Once you close Alpha Anywhere, the tunnel is closed automatically.  To minimize the need to keep updating the connection configuration in your other tool, Alpha Anywhere remembers the most recent port used and attempts to open it each time you open a tunnel to your database.
</p>
<br/>

<h4><a id="OpenSSHTunnel">Opening an SSH2 Tunnel To Your Database</a></h4>
<p>
Before a third party tool can access your database, you must open a tunnel.  
If you connect to your database using an AlphaDAO connection string, a tunnel is automatically opened and will stay             
open until Alpha Anywhere is closed.
</p>
<p>
You can explicitly open a tunnel using the Alpha Cloud dialogs to manage your test databases.
</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>To open an SSH tunnel to your database server:<br/><br/>
<ol>
	<li>Open the Managing Test Databases dialog as shown in 
		<a href="#ManagingTestDatabases">Managing Test Servers and Databases</a>
		</li>
	<li>Select one or more database servers by clicking the checkbox to the left of each server, or select all of them
		by clicking on the checkbox above the left-most column.
		</li><br/>
	<li>Open the menu by clicking on the "Actions..." button to the right.<br/><br/>
	    <img border="0" src="ScreenShots/TestDatabasesMainDialogMenu.jpg"><br/><br/>
		</li>
	<li>Select "Open SSH Tunnel" from the menu.</li>
	<li>A tunnel will be opened for each server you have selected if the tunnel is not already open.<br/><br/>
		Once the tunnels have been opened you will see a dialog confirming that the open was successful.<br/><br/>
		    <img border="0" src="ScreenShots/TestDatabasesSSHOpenSuccess.jpg"><br/><br/>
		As noted before, opening a tunnel is an expensive operation.  
		This may take several seconds for each tunnel you open.<br/><br/>
		If you get an error indicating that there was a timeout, wait a few seconds and try again.
		This can happen if you have just created your server as it can take a few seconds to spin up an 				instance.  SQL Server tends to take longer to start than some others.</br></br>
		If you continue to get a timeout error please contact support at alphacloudbugs@alphasoftware.com
		so we can work with you to diagnose and correct any issue with your server.
		</li><br/><br/>
	<li>Once a tunnel is open, you will see the Tunnel Status column of the server change to Active and 
		the Local Port column will contain the port in use for the tunnel.<br/><br/>
		In the section <a href="#SSHTunnelDetails">Getting SSH2 Tunnel Information for Third Party Tools</a>
		we will discuss how you can collect and provide the tunnel details to 
		a third party tool for accessing your database.
		</li>
</ol>

<h4><a id="CloseSSHTunnel">Closing an SSH2 Tunnel To Your Database</a></h4>
<p>
If you exit Alpha Anywhere, all SSH2 tunnels managed by Alpha Anywhere will be closed.  
You can also close tunnels from the Alpha Cloud dialogs.
</p>
<br/>
<p>To manually close an SSH tunnel to your database server:<br/>
<ol>
	<li>Open the Managing Test Databases dialog as shown in 
		<a href="#ManagingTestDatabases">Managing Test Servers and Databases</a>
		</li>
	<li>Select one or more database servers by clicking the checkbox to the left of each server, or select all of them
		by clicking on the checkbox above the left-most column.
		</li><br/>
	<li>Open the menu by clicking on the "Actions..." button to the right.<br/><br/>
	    <img border="0" src="ScreenShots/TestDatabasesMainDialogMenu.jpg"><br/><br/>
		</li>
	<li>Select "Close SSH Tunnel" from the menu.</li>
	<li>You will be prompted for permission to close any open tunnel on the selected servers.<br/><br/>
	    <img border="0" src="ScreenShots/TestDatabasesSSHCloseConfirmationDialog.jpg"><br/><br/>
		</li>
	<li>Click Yes to close any open tunnels to the selected servers.<br/><br/>
	<li>Once the tunnels have been closed you will see a dialog confirming that the close was successful.<br/><br/>
		    <img border="0" src="ScreenShots/TestDatabasesSSHCloseSuccess.jpg"><br/><br/>
	<li>Once a tunnel is closed, you will see the Tunnel Status column of the server change to Inactive and 
		the Local Port column will be cleared.
		</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<br/>

<h4><a id="SSHTunnelDetails">Getting SSH2 Tunnel Information for Third Party Tools</a></h4>
<p>
Using the Alpha Cloud dialogs, you can view and copy details that will help you set up a connection
to your test database from tools such as MySQL Workbench, PGAdmin4, and SQL Server Management Studio.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
From the perspective of these tools, the database is local to the current machine.
Instead of the ports MariaDB, PostgreSQL and SQL server typically use (3306, 5432 and 1433), 
you will connect to an open tunnel on created on the local machine using a local port defined by Alpha Anywhere.
The tunnel will take care of connecting to the right port on the database server within the test database cluster.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Third party development tools will always connect to your database using "localhost" and the port Alpha Anywhere
assigns to the tunnel.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
<strong>Note: </strong>When connecting to your test database from SQL Server Management Studio, be sure to enter the server name
as localhost followed by a comma and then the port number provided.  For example "localhost,51433", otherwise you will not be able to connect.
</p>
<br/>

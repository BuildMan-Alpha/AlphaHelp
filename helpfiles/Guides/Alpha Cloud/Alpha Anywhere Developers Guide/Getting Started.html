<h3><a id="SubscriptionsVersusUsers">Understanding Subscriptions and Users</a></h3>

<p>
A <strong>subscription</strong> is created when you sign up for Alpha Cloud on the Alpha Software web site.  
Each subscription has an owner, who is automatically entitled to publish web projects as applications and deploy to web sites.
The owner can then delegate permission to others either by assigning them as primary contacts or authorizing them for specific resources so they can publish and deploy to web sites as well.
</p>

<p>
A <strong>user</strong> is an individual identified by their e-mail address who can be authorized to publish web projects, deploy web sites and perform other management tasks on the Alpha Cloud.
Anyone can register as a user of the Alpha Cloud from within Alpha Anywhere.
The registration dialog is one of the Settings menu options on the Alpha Cloud toolbar item on the Alpha Anywhere web control panel.
Using this dialog is explained in detail below.
</p>
<p>
Having a user identifier and a valid password does not in and of itself let you do anything useful.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>If you purchase a subscription, the e-mail address you provide with your purchase becomes your Alpha Cloud user identifier.</p>
		<p>This user is automatically assigned as the owner of the new subscription.</p></li>
	<li><p>To access an active subscription you did not purchase, you must be authorized by the owner (or a designee) to do work on their behalf.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3><a id="ConfirmSubscription">Accessing Your Alpha Cloud Subscription For the First Time</a></h3>

<p>
When you purchase a subscription, an e-mail is sent to the e-mail address you provide with a confirmation token (a randomly generated string) that is used to confirm that you are in control of the e-mail account you provided.
In order to set your initial password, you must paste or type the confirmation token into the dialog below and enter and confirm your initial password.

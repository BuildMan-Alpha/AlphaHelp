<br/>

<p>Accounts are are collections of Alpha Cloud applications and deployments that you manage.  
They have a status and primary contact.  
Any users you authorize can manage those applications and deployments.
</p>

<p>To manage your accounts from within Alpha Anywhere:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click on the Alpha Cloud toolbar icon in the web control panel and select "Advanced" and then "Accounts" from the drop down menu.<br/><br/>

    <br/>
    </li>
    <br/>
	<li>To change the primary contact or the status of an account of which you are the primary contact or authorized maintainer, make the changes right in the grid.</li>
	<li>When you have finished making changes, click "Apply Changes" to update the cloud.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<p>To delete an account, click in the row of the account you want to delete and then click the button labeled 'Delete This Account'.

	</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You cannot undo this operation!</p>
<p>		You will not be allowed to delete the account you logged in with.  To delete that account, open the preferences dialog and select a different account.
</p>
<p>		You will not be allowed to delete the last account in your subscription.  
		To delete that account, you will need to create one to replace it and select the new account in the preferences dialog first.
</p>
<p>		Deleting an account permanently archives the account and any applications and deployments that belong to that account.  
		Any deployed applications will be terminated and removed from active web sites.
		You will still see usage reports for deleted deployments.
	</p>

You can authorize additional users to manage account resources by clicking on the button entitled "Manage Authorized Maintainers".

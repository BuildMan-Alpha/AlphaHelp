<p>Applications are fairly simple objects.  They have a status and primary contact, and any users you authorize to make changes to them or deploy.
</p>

<p>Application names must be unique within an account.
</p>

<p>To manage your applications from within Alpha Anywhere:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click on the Alpha Cloud toolbar icon in the web control panel and select "Advanced" and then "Applications" from the drop down menu.<br/><br/>
    <img border="0" src="ScreenShots/WebControlPanelAlphaCloudMenuAdvanced.jpg">
    <br/>
    </li>
    <br/>
	<li>To add a new application, click in the empty row at the bottom of the grid.<br/>
		<ul>
			<li>Enter a name for your new application></li>
			<li>The default status is "Active", but you can choose to create the application with a "Disabled" status.</li>
			<li>The default primary contact is the account primary contact, but you can change it.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>To change the status or primary contact of an existing user, make the changes right in the grid.</li>
	<li>When you have finished making changes, click "Apply Changes" to update the cloud.</li>
	<li>Once you have saved a new application, you can authorize additional users to manage and publish the application by clicking on the button entitled "Manage Authorized Maintainers".
		For more information on authorized maintainers see <a href="Delegating Access.html">Delegating Access</a>.
		</li>
	<br/>
<img border="0" src="ScreenShots/ManageApplications.jpg">
</ol>
<br/>
<p>To delete an application, click in the row of the application you want to delete and then click the button labeled 'Delete This Application'.
	</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You cannot undo this operation!
		Deleting an application permanently archives the application and any deployments that belong to that application as well.
		Any scheduled deployment that is archived will be terminated and removed from the active web site it is assigned to.
		You will still see usage reports for deleted deployments.
	</p>
<br/>


<h3><a id="ManagingApplicationProperties">Managing Application Properties</a></h3><br/>

<p>Web projects you create in the Alpha Anywhere development environment generally include one or more connection strings for ADO, Alpha DAO, or Storage.
The connection strings you define in the Alpha Anywhere development environment are automatically published to Alpha Cloud along with your web project.
After your application is published, you can view and edit connection strings and add constants you would like to be available to your running application.
</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  Connection strings are set in the Alpha Anywhere publish profile.
You can override constants and connection strings for an application on each deployment.
Those overrides will take precedence over any value set when the application is published.
See <a href="Managing Deployments.html#ManageDeploymentProperties">Managing Deployment Properties</a> for more on deployment properties

<h4><a id="ManagingApplicationConstants">Managing Application Constants</a></h4>
<p>Alpha Cloud maintains application constants in the deployed configuration file.
Each constant has a name and a string value.
You can access the values of those constants using the following Xbasic syntax in A5W pages and server side event scripts:</p><br>

<ul>
	<li><p>Constants You Define</p>
		<p><strong>Context.ApplicationConfiguration.GetConstant("&lt;My Application Constant Name&gt;")</strong></p></li></br>
	<li><p>Alpha Defined Constants</p>
		<p><strong>Context.ApplicationConfiguration.</strong>&lt;Predefined Alpha Constant Name&gt;</p>
		<p>For Example: <strong>Context.ApplicationConfiguration.ServerProduct</strong></p>

		<p>Alpha Cloud automatically populates the following Alpha constants for applications deployed on Alpha Cloud:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><strong>ServerProduct</strong> - The Alpha Anywhere Application Server product your application is deployed on</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>AlphaCloud</strong> - if your are deployed on Alpha Cloud</li>
					<li><strong>ApplicationServerIIS</strong> - if you are deployed under Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS</li>
					<li><strong>ApplicationServerClassic</strong> - if you are deployed on Alpha Anywhere Application Server Classic.</li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong>Subscription</strong> - The name of your subscription</li>
			<li><strong>Account</strong> - The name of the account (defaults to "Primary")</li>
			<li><strong>Application</strong> - The name you assigned your application when you published</li>
			<li><strong>Deployment</strong> - The name you assigned your deployment (defaults to "Primary")</li>
			<li><strong>WebSite</strong> - The name you assigned to your web site (defaults to "Primary")</li>
			<li><strong>WebSiteRegion</strong> - The name of the region your web site is deployed in</li>
			<li><strong>ApplicationVersion</strong> - The publication number; automatically sequenced from one each time you publish</li>
			<li><strong>ApplicationPublicationDate</strong> - The date and time this version of your application was published</li>
			<li><strong>ApplicationDeploymentDate</strong> - The date and time this version of your application was deployed</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="ManagingAlphaDAOConnectionStrings">Managing Alpha DAO Connection Strings</a></h4>
<p>
<strong>Note: </strong>Alpha DAO connection strings are generally referenced by a unique name within the application and components. 
This name acts as a placeholder for the actual connection string. 
By using a name for a connection string, it is possible to change the value by overriding the named connection string value at publication time or in a deployment definition.
The same named connection may have one value in Alpha Anywhere, but reference a different value in the publish profile.
Each time you publish, the value set in your publish profile replaces the default connection string value set for the Application on Alpha Cloud for each name.
</p>
<p>Alpha Cloud also allows you to override the connection string value for each deployment of your published application.
Deployment level overrides for named connection strings persist regardless of what value is subsequently published at the Application level.

<h4><a id="ManagingIPRestrictions">Managing IP Restrictions</a></h4>
<p>
By default, your application will allow access from any source IP address.
You can set IP restrictions for an application or deployment to either allow specific IP addresses or to deny specific IP addresses from accessing your web site.
</p>
<p>IP addresses are specified for version 4 (IPV4) addresses.
IPV6 is not yet supported.
An IP version 4 address is made up of four separate numbers from 0 to 255 and separated by periods.
For example, 192.168.0.1 is an address that is often used by local networks.
</p>
<p>
Restrictions are specified using the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) format.
The CIDR format combines an IPV4 address, followed by a forward slash (/) and then adds a number that determines how many of the numbers (beginning at the left) are significant.
Since each number ranges from 0 to 255, each of the four numbers will be stored as an eight bit binary number.
The total length of an IPV4 address is thirty-two bits.
</p>
<p>For example:<br/>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>192.168.0.0/16 </strong> - matches any address that starts with 192.168 (16 bits).</li>
		<li><strong>192.168.0.12/32 </strong> - matches only the address 192.168.0.12 (all 32 bits)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The bit length value 0 is used with the address 0.0.0.0 (as in 0.0.0.0/0) to mean "all addresses".  That value is not particularly useful for IP restrictions as preventing all addresses does not make your site very useful and allowing all addresses is the default behavior anyway.
</p>

<p>To edit IP restrictions for your application:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Open the <a href="#ManagingApplicationsDialog">Managing Applications Dialog</a> discussed above.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click on the row of the application you want to manage properties for.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click on the button labeled "Manage Properties".</p></li>
	<li><p>The Manage Application Properties dialog will display.</p>

	<li><p>The "IP Restrictions" panel will be displayed.</p>
			<img border="0" src="ScreenShots/ManageApplicationPropertiesIPRestrictions.jpg">
			<br/><br/>
			</li>
	<li><p>Click the "Enable IP Restrictions" checkbox to enable IP specific access.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Select the default behavior (allow or deny all addresses).</p></li>
			<li><p>Choose whether you want to check both the source IP from the incoming connection and the x-forwarded-for header in determining
				whether to allow or deny access.</p></li>
			<li><p>Select the action to take when access is denied.  Your options are:</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Abort </strong>- Actively disconnect the connection.</li>
				<li><strong>401 - Unauthorized </strong>- Return a status code of 401 indicating the access is unauthorized.</li>
				<li><strong>403 - Forbidden </strong>- Return a status code of 403 indicating the access is forbidden.</li>
				<li><strong>404 - Not Found </strong>- Return a status code of 404 indicating that the requested resource was not found</li>
				</ul>
			    </p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Add IP addresses (in CIDR format) that are exceptions to the default behavior (allow or deny).</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
				<li>Enter a new IP address and tab away from the cell to add another one.</li>
				<li>Use the Delete Selected entry to delete items you have selected.</li>
				<li>Click the Sort Exceptions button to reorder the IP addresses in ascending order for readability.</li>
				</ul>

<h4><a id="ManagingLogCustomStorage">Managing Log Custom Storage</a></h4>
<p>Alpha Cloud encrypts and copies log files from running servers to private storage so you can retrieve them from within Alpha Anywhere even when the instances have shut down.</p>
<p> You can request that the log files also be copied to your own cloud storage (currently S3 or Azure) as well.
This is useful if you have a log analysis tool that is capable of pulling in files automatically and running analytics against them.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Alpha Cloud copies partially complete log files to private storage so you have access to them in Alpha Anywhere sooner.
Because some log analyzers require a complete file, log files are not copied to custom log storage until they are complete.
As a result you will see a delay in logs moving to log custom storage.</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Open the <a href="#ManagingApplicationsDialog">Managing Applications Dialog</a> discussed above.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click on the row of the application you want to manage properties for.</p></li>

				<li><strong>IIS</strong> - The standard Microsoft Internet Information Services logs.</li>
				<li><strong>IISFailedRequest</strong> - The failed request log files.</li>
				<li><strong>Xbasic</strong> - The Xbasic log file in common log format.
					You can select to store this file as CSV (Comma Separated Variable) or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) formatted entries.

<h3><a id="Overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>Web sites define where your web applications will run and how your users will access them.
</p><br/>
<p>A web site can run multiple applications. 
Each application is assigned to a web site and identified with a virtual path that is added to the URL that would be used for the root application ("/").
For example, if you have a root application and an application called "Accounting" and your web site is accessed with the URL "http://myhost.mycompany.com",
the accounting application would be referenced using the URL "http://myhost.mycompany.com/Accounting".
</p>

<h3><a id="Properties">Web Site Properties</a></h3>
<p>Each web site has the following properties:</p><br>
<dl>
	<dt><strong>Name</strong></dt><dd>A unique identifier within your subscription.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Status</strong></dt><dd>Either "Active" or "Disabled".
		<br/>
		<strong>Note:</strong> Disabling a web site will shut down all applications deployed to it.
		<br/>
		</dd>
	<dt><strong>Primary Contact</strong></dt><dd>The individual who should be contacted regarding issues with the site.
		</dd>
	<dt><strong>Host Name</strong></dt><dd>The host and domain name for IIS to listen for in addition to the automatically generated DNS address Alpha Cloud creates and manages.
		The host name is optional.  You can run your web site using the name generated by Alpha Cloud if you wish.
		This is the name of the host and domain you register with your DNS provider.
		This name must be globally unique across the internet and will not be effective until you update your DNS entries.
		See <a href="Domains.html">Managing Domains</a>.
		</dd>
	<dt><strong>Service</strong></dt><dd>Determines whether users access your site using HTTP, HTTPS or both.
		If you use only the automatically generated DNS name, Alpha Cloud manages both the DNS name and the SSL certificate.
		If you set a host name and enable SSL, you must also provide a certificate.
		</dd>
	<dt><strong>Certificate</strong></dt><dd>Select a certificate you have uploaded that matches the host name your provided.
		If you provide a host name of your own, you must upload a valid certificate in order to support SSL.
		The certificate will be installed on deployed servers automatically.
		To upload a new certificate, click on the button entitled "Upload Certificate".
		For more information on uploading certificates see <a href="Certificates.html#UploadCertificate">Uploading Certificates</a>.
		</dd>
	<dt><strong>Geographic Region</strong></dt><dd>The geographic region you want to deploy your web site in.
		Choose the region your web site should be deployed in.
		<br/>
		<strong>Note:</strong> For best response, make sure your database and storage objects are deployed in the same region as your web site.
		</dd>
	<dt><strong>Tenancy</strong></dt><dd>Tenancy determines how your web site will be grouped with other web sites on the Alpha Cloud.
		<br/>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Public</strong> - The web site will share virtual machines with any other web sites deployed on the Alpha Cloud.</li>
			<li><strong>Subscription</strong> - The web site will share virtual machines ONLY with other web sites belonging to the same subscription and assigned to the same server group.
				The tuning parameters for the server group will be taken from the common server group object.
				</li>
			<li><strong>Single</strong> - The web site will be assigned to its own virtual machines.  The tuning parameters will be taken from the referenced server group.</li>
		</ul>
		</dd>
	<dt><strong>Server Group</strong></dt><dd>The group (as described above) that the web site is assigned to.
		For more information on server groups, see <a href="Managing Server Groups.html">Managing Server Groups</a>.
		</dd>

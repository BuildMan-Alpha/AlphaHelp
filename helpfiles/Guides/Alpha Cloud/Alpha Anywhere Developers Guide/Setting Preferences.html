The first time you access Alpha Cloud dialogs in Alpha Anywhere that require a password, the Alpha Cloud Preferences dialog (shown below) will be displayed. 
You can also open the dialog in the web control panel in Alpha Anywhere by clicking on the Alpha Cloud toolbar icon and selecting "Settings" and then "Preferences" from the drop down menu.

<h3><a id="Overview">Overview</a></h3>

<p>Alpha Cloud is about deploying applications directly from Alpha Anywhere.
If you are building a SaaS (Software as a Service) application you may want to deploy published applications automatically to implement provisioning and maintenance.
The Alpha Cloud XBasic API (Application Programming Interface) makes it possible to build a web application that can be used to do this.
</p><br/>


<p>With the Alpha Cloud XBasic API, you can manage web sites, security applications and deployments from XBasic on either the desktop or Alpha Cloud.
In this section we will introduce the concepts and help you get started in automating deployment from within an XBasic script.
</p>

<p><strong>Notes: </strong></br/>
<ol>
	<li>The XBasic script you are running will most likely be part of a web application and quite possibly running on Alpha Cloud itself.</li>
	<li>The functions implemented in the Alpha Cloud XBasic API focus on automation of SaaS applications.  
		Many tasks (such as uploading certificates and publishing applications) must still be done using the Alpha Cloud Dialog interface.
		</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h3><a id="TasksYouCanPerform">Tasks You Can Perform</a></h3>

<p>Your provisioning application may be used by your own internal staff or prospective customers.
You will see a number of functions that can help you navigate your own subscription as well those with which you can populate dropdown lists for prospects.

<h4><a id="AutomatedDeployment">Automated Deployment</a></h4>

<p>The functions below schedule a deployment, create a new deployment for an existing web site and security application, or create everything from scratch.</p>

<table>

	<tr><td>ScheduleApplicationDeployment()</td>
		<td>Creates a new schedule item for an existing deployment selecting application version and Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS build.
			This function assumes the deployment has already been added and the web site and security application have already been assigned.
			</td></tr>
	<tr><td>DeployApplicationToWebSite()</td>
		<td>Deploys a previously published application to a web site.
			The web site and security application must exist, but the deployment is created if it does not exist.
			</td></tr>
	<tr><td>DeployApplicationComplete()</td>
		<td>Does a complete deployment of a previously published application.
			Any objects not previously defined, such as web sites and security applications, can be created at the same time.
			Again, the caller must have permission to create any needed resources.
			</td></tr>
</table>

<h4><a id="ListItems">List Items</a></h4>

<p>The "List" functions return lists of items suitable for adding to dropdown lists for selection.
</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Some of the lists are global and others depend on setting the current subscription, 
account, application and/or deployment to establish the context of the call.
</p>

<table>
	<tr><td>ListAccounts()</td><td>Returns a crlf() delimited list of all accounts for the current subscription.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ListApplications()</td><td>Returns a crlf() delimited list of applications for the current subscription and account.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ListApplicationVersions()</td><td>Returns a crlf() delimited list of versions of the current application that have been published.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ListBuilds()</td><td>Returns a crlf() delimited list of Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS builds available.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ListCertificates()</td><td>Returns a crlf() delimited list of certificate names for the current subscription.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ListRegions()</td><td>Returns a crlf() delimited list of regions available.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ListServerGroups()</td><td>Returns a crlf() delimited list of server groups for the current subscription.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ListWebSites()</td><td>Returns a crlf() delimited list of web sites for the current subscription.</td></tr>
</table>

<h4><a id="ValidationFunctions">Validation Functions</a></h4>

<p>There are also validation functions that can be used to verify manually entered input.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<br/>
<table>
	<tr><td>CertificateNameIsValid()</td><td>Returns .t. if the certificate named is valid.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>RegionNameIsValid()</td><td>Returns .t. if the specified region name is valid></td></tr>
	<tr><td>RegularExpressionIsValid()</td><td>Returns .t. if a regular expression is valid.  
		This function can be used when prompting for a regular expression to be used to validate a password when setting up a Security Application.
		</td></tr>
</table>


<h3><a id="GettingStarted">Getting Started</a></h3>

<p>The Alpha Cloud XBasic API exposes many of the same services provided by dialogs, but with a slightly simpler programmatic API.  
For example GUIDs are used internally to create unique keys.  These are not exposed in the Alpha Cloud API.
</p>

<p>To use the Alpha Cloud XBasic API we need to create a programmatic token to stand in for our password in code.  
For each web request that invokes the API we will also need to register the API and create a client object to make calls with.
</p>

<p>This section will walk through the steps needed to make some simple calls to the Alpha Cloud XBasic API.</p>

<br/>
<p>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Creating a Programmatic Token</strong><br/>

		<p>Alpha Cloud includes the ability to create a programmatic token so that your user password does not need to be embedded into XBasic code or stored with your program data.  
			You will still want to protect your token, but the token separates password management from program maintenance.  
			Either your password or a token you maintain can be used to log in to the Alpha Cloud API (think of the token as standing in for your password).
			</p>

		<p>To create a programmatic token, select Alpha Cloud from the web control panel and then select Settings and Generate Programmatic Token from the menus that drop down.
			</p>
		<img border="0" src="ScreenShots/WebControlPanelAlphaCloudMenuSecurityProgrammaticToken.jpg">
    		<br/>

		<p>	Using the Generate Programmatic Token dialog, you can create up to two programmatic tokens (new ones after that will rotate out the oldest token).  
			It is recommended that you rotate tokens out on a schedule to protect access to your Alpha Cloud user account.
			</p>
		<p><strong>Note: </strong>Be sure to save your token off someplace safe when you create it.  
			Tokens are securely hashed and cannot be retrieved later.
			</p>
		<img border="0" src="ScreenShots/GenerateProgrammaticToken.jpg">
		</p>
		<br/>
		</li>

	<li><p><strong>Registering the API</strong><br/>

		<p>Once per process execution, the Alpha Cloud API must be registered.  
			This process checks for the latest DLL, and installs a new one if necessary and then loads the DLL and registers types in the XBasic namespace system.
			When running on Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS as a web request, you will want to do this at least once for the request.
			You can do this on an A5W page, or in the function that handles the request.
			</p>
		<p><strong>Note: </strong>There is no performance penalty for additional calls to register the API.</p>

		<p>The XBasic code required to do this as follows (shown in an interactive window session):</p>
		<br/>
		<p>	r = AlphaCloud::API::Register()<br/>
			?r.Success
		</p>

		<p>The Register() function returns a CallResult object a Success, a Warning and an Error logical properties and a Text property with more complete information.</p>

		<p>Once the API is registered, the AlphaCloud namespace is populated.</p>

		</p>
		<br/>
		</li>
	
	<li><p><strong>Creating the API Client</strong><br/>

		<p>To call functions on the Alpha Cloud XBasic API you will need to dimension the client as follows:</p>

		<p>DIM cl as alphacloud::Client = new Alphacloud::Client(":&lt;my user name/e-mail&gt; ", "&lt;my password or programmatic token&gt;", “&lt;my subscription name&gt;”)</p>

		<p><strong>Note: </strong>There are other optional parameters that are used for Alpha Software development staff for testing.</p>

		</p>
		<br/>
		</li>

	<li><p><strong>Populating Variables With the Current Context</strong><br/>

		<p>Depending on the function you call, you may need to provide more context information for the call.
		For example, a valid subscription is required to list out available regions, but you cannot schedule a deployment without providing 
		the names of the affected account and application).
		</p>

		<p>To set the context, simply assign the names to the related properties as below.</p>

		<p>	
			<table>
				<tr><td>cl.SubscriptionName</td><td>=</td><td>"Alpha Software"</td></tr>
				<tr><td>cl.Account</td><td>=</td><td>"Primary"</td></tr>
				<tr><td>cl.Application</td><td>=</td><td>"DemoMobile"</td></tr>
			</table>
		</p>

		<p><strong>Note: </strong>You can omit the subscription name on the constructor and set it as above.  
				As long as the property is set before the first API call, you will not get an error.
				</p>

		<p>Remember,a subscription has one or more accounts.  
			The default account name is “Primary”).  
			You can create applications within an account and then create one or more deployments for each application.  
			This hierarchy provides a complete path to a deployment.
			</p>
		<br/>
		<p><strong>Subscription<br/>
			Account<br/>
			Application<br/>
			Deployment</strong></p>

		<p>Web sites, security applications and server groups are all owned by the subscription directly.</p>

		</p>
		<br/>
		</li>

	<li><p><strong>Calling API Client Functions</strong><br/>

		<p>Once you have registered the Alpha Cloud API, dimensioned your client object and set the context, you can begin calling API functions.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>	dim RegionList as C<br/>
			?cl.ListRegions(RegionList)<br/>
			?RegionList<br/>
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Note that Alpha Cloud API uses the pattern common to Alpha Anywhere of returning a logical .t. or .f. from function calls.  
		The property <strong>CallResult</strong> has the description of any error that may have occurred:</p>
		<br/>
		<p>? cl.CallResult.text</p>
		</p>
		<br/>
		</li>
</ol>
</p>
<br/>

<h3><a id="AMoreCompleteExample">A More Complete Example</a></h3>

<p>Here is a more complete example. 
The XBasic script below registers the Alpha Cloud XBasic API, dimensions a client object, sets the context and lists out the regions.
</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>If you run the script below in the XBasic interactive window it will display a list of regions.
</p>
<br/>
<p>	r = AlphaCloud::API::Register()<br/>
	?r.Success<br/><br/>
	DIM cl as alphacloud::Client = new Alphacloud::Client("&lt;my user name/e-mail&gt; ", "&lt;my password or programmatic token&gt;")<br/>
	cl.SubscriptionName      = "Alpha Software"<br/>
	cl.Account               = "Primary"<br/>
	cl.Application           = "DemoMobile"<br/><br/>

	dim RegionList as C<br/>
	?cl.ListRegions(RegionList)<br/>
	?RegionList<br/>
	</p>
<br/>

<h3><a id="DeployingPreviouslyPublished">Deploying a Previously Published Application</a></h3>

<p>There are three ways to get your application deployed to a web site.  
Depending on your needs you can use the functions as you require.</p>

<p>In order to deploy a published application we need a  web site, a security application and server group (in public tenancy, this value is ignored, so set it to "Default").
You must define or create a web site.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>ScheduleApplicationDeployment()</dt>
		<dd>Use this function to schedule a deployment (start a web site/application with a specific version of your application, 
		a specific build of Alpha Anywhere and a logging option as well as an option for security publication).</dd>
	<dt>DeployApplicationToWebSite()</dt>
		<dd>Use this function to deploy to an existing web site and security application (the deployment does not need to exist yet).</dd>
	<dt>DeployApplicationComplete()</dt>
		<dd>Use this function to deploy an existing application version to a web site, security application and deployment.  
		None of the objects need be defined before making this call.  
		It does a complete deployment in a single call.  
		The parameters are more complicated for this function, but it can be easier to use, once they are set up.</dd>
</dl>


<h3><a id="DeployApplicationComplete">Calling DeployApplicationComplete()</a></h3>

<p>The function DeployApplicationComplete()can be used to create a new web site, security application and deployment and to schedule deployment 
of a previously published application.</p>
<p>In the example interactive session below, you can see the definitions of the web site, the security application and the deployment as well as the schedule itself.</p>
<br/>

<p>

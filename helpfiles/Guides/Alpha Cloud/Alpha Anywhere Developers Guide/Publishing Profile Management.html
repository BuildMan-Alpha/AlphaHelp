<h3><a id="CreatingACloudPublishProfile">Creating a Cloud Publish Profile</a></h3>
<ol>
	<li>Begin by clicking on the web control panel toolbar icon labeled "Publish" to open the "Publish Web Project" dialog.</p>
<br/>
<img border="0" src="ScreenShots/AlphaAnywhereWebProjectControlPanel.jpg">
<br/>
	<li>Click the Add/Edit Profile icon by the profile names to display a the current profiles.</p>
<br/>
<img border="0" src="ScreenShots/AlphaAnywherePublishWebProject.jpg">
<br/>

	<li>Click the button entitled "Add New Profile" to create a new profile.</p>
<br/>
<img border="0" src="ScreenShots/AlphaAnywhereWebProjectProfiles.jpg">
<br/>

	<li>Click the Alpha Cloud radio button, then click the button labeled "Finish".</li>
<br/>

<img border="0" src="ScreenShots/AlphaAnywhereNewPublishingProfile.jpg">
<br/>
	<li><p>Depending on how many Alpha Cloud subscriptions and accounts you are authorized to manage, and the preferences you have set, a different dialog will be displayed.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>If you have a single subscription and account, the basic publish dialog below will be displayed. 
			Complete the entries in the dialog as described previously in <a href="Publishing.html#PublishSettingsBasic">Basic Publish Settings</a>.
			</p>
			<p>After completing the initial publish settings and clicking OK, you will be prompted to name your new profile.
			</p><br/>

		</li>
		<li><p>If you have permission to manage multiple subscriptions and accounts, follow the instructions in <a href="Advanced Publishing.html">Advanced Publishing Support in Alpha Anywhere</a>.
			</p>
			<p>After completing the initial publish settings and clicking OK, you will be prompted to name your new profile.

			<br/>
			<br/>
			<strong>Note: </strong>To save some steps, you can click on the button labeled Quick Configuration.  
			The dialog below will let you create your application, one or more deployments, web sites, and security applications with a single click.<br/><br/>
			<img border="0" src="ScreenShots/QuickConfiguration.jpg">
			<p>
			The application name defaults to a combination of your workspace and your web project names.  
			This makes sense because a web project is published to the application each time you make changes.
			With few exceptions, you only need a single publish profile for each application being published to Alpha Cloud.
			</p>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Select <strong>Simple </strong>to create a single deployment, assign it to the root of a web site, and create a single security application.</li>
				<li>Select <strong>Development and Production Deployments </strong>to create a deployment for development and a deployment for production.
						Each time you publish, your default will be to deploy to a development web site.
						When you are ready, you can use the Manage Deployments dialog to pull a specific version of your application to production.
						<strong>Note: </strong>You can opt to share users and roles across the three deployments or create a unique security application for each.
						</li>
				<li>Select <strong>Development, Test, and Production Deployments </strong>to create a deployment for development, one for test, and one for production.
						Each time you publish, your default will be to deploy to a development web site.
						When you are ready, you can use the Manage Deployments dialog to pull a specific version of your application to test or production.
						<strong>Note: </strong>You can opt to share users and roles across the three deployments or create a unique security application for each.
						</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

	</ul>
	</li>
<br/>
	<li>Give your new profile a name and click the OK button.</li>

<p>Once you have created your publish profile, you can use that profile again and again to publish new versions of your web project.</p>
<br/>
<ol>
	<li>Begin by clicking on the web control panel toolbar icon labeled "Publish" to open the "Publish Web Project" dialog.</p>
		</li>
<br/>
<br/>

	<li>At the Alpha Anywhere Publish Web Project dialog, select your Alpha Cloud publish profile, make any changes to settings and click the "Publish" button.</li>

<br/>
<br/>
	<li><p>Alpha Anywhere will gather up the components required and display the Files to be Published dialog (Note: You can check "Don't show this list again" to skip this step in the future).</p>
		<p>click the OK button to proceed with publishing your web project to the cloud.
		</p></li>
<br/>
<br/>
<img border="0" src="ScreenShots/AlphaAnywherePublishProgress.jpg">

	<li><p>The Alpha Cloud Publish Progress dialog will be displayed while your web project is being published and deployed on the Alpha Cloud.</p>
		</li>
<br/>
<br/>
<img border="0" src="ScreenShots/AlphaCloudPublishProgress.jpg">
<br/>
<br/>
	<li><p>After a successful publish, the Application Published to Alpha Cloud dialog below will be displayed.
		The dialog will automatically update showing you the current status as your application is being deployed.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Follow the instructions on the page:</p>
		<br/>
		<p>For example you can click on the link to go directly to your deployed application.  This will close the dialog.</p> 
		<br/>
		<p>You can also copy the link to your application to the clipboard and paste it into a browser later.</p>
		<br/>
		<p><strong>Note: </strong>Keep in mind that if a new server instance must be started, you may have to wait a while to access your application.
		If you deploy in public tenancy, your application may be available in a matter of seconds.

    <description>Alpha Launch allows you to install mobile Alpha Anywhere apps to Apple and Android devices without using Ionic Appflow, Cordova CLI, or an AppStore.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>Alpha Launch is a free AppStore app available for Android or Apple devices. Alpha Anywhere applications can be downloaded and installed within Alpha Launch. Applications deployed to Alpha Launch do not need to go through the Apple or Android app stores. Apps deployed to Alpha Launch also do not require a additional tools to create applications with Ionic Appflow or Cordova CLI. Alpha Anywhere mobile apps are installed into Alpha Launch, not directly to the device. This makes it extremely easy and quick to install new apps on a device.</p>

                <title>Publishing Apps to a Device using Alpha Launch</title>
                <description>
                    <p>Publishing mobile apps to an app store can be a time consuming and frustrating experience. With Alpha Launch you can quickly and easily publish mobile apps to iOS and Android devices, completely bypassing the app stores, Ionic Appflow, and Cordova CLI.</p>
                    <p>In this video we show how you can publish an app to a device using Alpha Launch.</p>

            <list bullet="true">
                <item>
                    <name>You are developing a mobile app for a client and you want the client to be able to install and test the app on their own device</name>

                <item>
                    <name>You want a quick and easy way to update previously installed apps on a device without having to wait for app store approval.</name>

            <description>
                <p>Once an app has been installed into Alpha Launch, the app runs similarly to the way it would operate if installed directly on the device. For example, if there is no internet connection, you can launch any app installed in Alpha Launch.</p>
                <p>Alpha Launch is not suitable as a means of deploying a public facing app that will be installed by many users who will go to the app store to find and install your App. When an app is installed directly onto a device the app icon will appear on the device's home screen. However, when you publish to Alpha Launch, the app will not have an icon on the home screen. To launch the app you will first have to open Alpha Launch and select the app from the list of apps installed in Alpha Launch.</p>
            </description>
            <note>Apps installed in Alpha Launch are Cordova applications (even though you did not have to go through the Ionic Appflow or Cordova CLI build process) and they can use any of the Cordova plugins that Alpha Launch exposes. For more information see [Understanding Alpha Launch Limitations].</note>
        </section>
        <section>
            <note>On Apple devices, there are other ways that you can allow a user to test an app that you are developing using the Apple Test Flight system. However, setting up Test Flight is complex.</note>

            <title>Preparing your App to Publish to Alpha Launch</title>
            <description>
                <p>Apps deployed to Alpha Launch need to give the user a way to get back to the Alpha Launch home screen. This is often done by adding a button to the component that runs the *[ui:Exit to AlphaLaunch home screen]* action.</p>
                <p>You can alternatively code the Javascript for the button yourself.</p>
                <p>To use Action Javascript, select the '[AlphaLaunch Actions]' action for the list of available Action Javascript actions.</p>
                <p>To code the Javascript directly, use this code:</p>
                <p>
                    <example code="js"><![CDATA[if (A5.shell) { 
    A5.shell.exitComponent();
}]]></example>
                </p>
                <p>The code tests if you are running in Alpha Launch, then if you are then it calls the *[js:A5.shell.exitComponent()]* method.</p>

                    <description>Defines the type of download. Options are *[ui:manifest]* or *[ui:singleWithHeader]*.  *[ui:manifest]* publishes all app files individually. *[ui:singleWithHeader]* publishes the app as a single file. *[ui:singleWithHeader]* is recommended for publishing. With this option, all of the files that need to be installed on the device are combined into a single file which is then downloaded and unpacked on the device. It is considerably quicker to download a single large file than hundreds of smaller files. *[ui:singleWithHeader]* is only available under Alpha Anywhere 4.5.4.1 or newer and only works with Alpha Launch 2.1.1 (released June 18, 2018.)</description>

                    <name>Download location</name>
                    <description>If you leave this property blank, the app files are download from a folder in the webroot of your Alpha Anywhere server. However, you can download the app files from another server if you wish. For example, you might want to have Alpha Launch download the app files from Amazon S3. In this case you would enter the URL of the bucket on S3 where you have placed the app files. For example: http://mys3account.s3.amazonaws.com/app1. For more information on why you might want to specify another server (such as S3) as the download location see App Install Errors below.</description>

                <p>Once you have registered all of the apps in a Web Project that you want to publish to Alpha Launch you are nearly ready to publish to Alpha Launch.</p>
                <p>Before you can publish, you must first define a Publishing Profile that indicates where the apps will be published (i.e. the Alpha Anywhere server and folder on that server where the apps will be published). To define a publishing profile, click the Profiles button on the toolbar when the Web Project Control Panel has focus.</p>

            <note>Each Web Project will typically be published to its own Alpha Launch server address. For example, you may have 3 UX components in 'Web Project1' that you want to publish to Alpha Launch and 2 UX components in 'Web Project2' that you want to publish to Alpha Launch. In both cases you may want to use the same physical Alpha Anywhere server. The Publishing Profile that you define for 'Web Project1' might specify that you want to publish to a folder called 'webProject1', in which case the server address for the 3 apps in this group of apps might be something like 'http://www.myAAserver/webProject1'. On the other hand, the Publishing Profile you define for 'Web Project2' might specify that you want to publish to a folder called 'webProject2', in which case the server address for the 2 apps in this group of apps might be something like 'http://www.myAAserver/webProject2'.</note>
            <tip>
                <p>You can publish apps to and install from the Development Server. To do this, specify the IP address for you computer and the port number in the Server Address. For example, "http://192.168.70.120:8080/alphalaunch". This should only be done for testing purposes as your local IP address is not static.</p>

                    <description>
                        <p>It is important to understand the key concepts of how Alpha Launch works. There are two servers:</p>

                        <step>
                            <description>
                                <p>The download server is where the apps that you install into Alpha Launch are downloaded from.</p>
                            </description>
                        </step>
                        <step>
                            <description>
                                <p>The Alpha Anywhere server is where an app that is running in Alpha Launch will make its Ajax callbacks.</p>
                            </description>
                        </step>
                    </steps>
                    <note>
                        <p>The Alpha Anywhere server and the download server can be the same or they can be different. For example, it is common to use an Amazon S3 bucket as the download server. The Alpha Anywhere server can be your own classic or IIS Alpha Anywhere server, or it could be Alpha Cloud.</p>
                    </note>
                </case>
                <case>
                    <description>
                        <p>If you use an Amazon S3 bucket as your download server, you can either use your own private bucket, or you can use a special shared bucket provided by Alpha Software. The shared S3 bucket is a quick and easy way to get started, but ultimately you will likely want to use a private S3 bucket.</p>
                        <p>When you publish an app to Alpha Launch you specify a publishing profile. This profile determines how your apps are published to the Alpha Anywhere server.</p>
                        <p>Once an app has been installed into Alpha Launch it will appear on the Alpha Launch home screen.</p>
                        <p>For example the screen shot below shows Alpha Launch running on a mobile phone. There are two apps installed. If you tap on one of the items in the List, the app is launched from the file system on the device. Just like when you load an app that you previously installed on a device from an App store by tapping its icon on the device home screen, you do not need to have an internet connection to load an app into Alpha Launch. That is because the app has been physically installed into the file system on the device, and the app is loaded from the file system. Of course, if the app you load makes Ajax callbacks, you will need to have an internet connection.</p>

                                <p>This is the URL of the Alpha Anywhere server where your app will be published. The value for this property depends on what Profile you use to publish your apps. This is the server that will handle Ajax callbacks made by your app. If you do not use an Amazon S3 bucket as your download server, it is also the server from which Alpha Launch will download the app when you install it into Alpha Launch.</p>
                                <p>If you are using an Alpha Cloud publishing profile and you are unsure of the Server URL, you can set the Server URL to &lt;Auto&gt; and Alpha Anywhere will automatically figure out what the correct value is for the Server URL based on the Publishing profile you selected. There is, however, a disadvantage to using the &lt;Auto&gt; option as it means that Alpha Anywhere will have to go through additional time consuming steps when you publish to Alpha Launch.</p>

                                <p>In order to install apps into Alpha Launch you first have to register the URL of the download server in the Alpha Launch app. Typing a long URL on a mobile keyboard is tedious and it is much easier to register a server by simply scanning a QR code. To display the QR code for the download server, check the checkbox for the Show QR code prompt. Enter a server name and description and then click the Show QR code hyperlink. This will display a QR code that you can scan in Alpha Launch.</p>

                                <p>When you publish files to Alpha Launch, a Deployment Package (also known as a fileset) must be created. This fileset is stored in the files directory in the __alphaLaunch.alphaLaunch folder in the Web Project folder. The fileset is automatically created when you publish to Alpha Launch, but you might want to create the fileset manually before you initiate the publish so that you can examine the files in the fileset.</p>

            <title>Troubleshooting</title>
            <description>
                <p>The most common problem with Alpha Launch is that after you have published apps to your Alpha Launch server and you then go to Alpha Launch to install the apps you just published, the apps are not listed on the apps to Install screen. This cause of this problem is either the Application Server has not been started, or the Server Address (i.e. URL) that was entered in the Publish to Alpha Launch dialog was incorrect.</p>
                <p>You can test if you entered a valid server address by going to a browser and entering the following URL into the browser</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[<server URL>/availableAppInfo.txt]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p> For example, if your server URL was entered as:</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[http://192.168.70.157/AlphaLaunchDemo]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p>You would enter this address into the browser address bar:</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[http://192.168.70.157/AlphaLaunchDemo/availableAppInfo.txt]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p>If you do not receive a response, then it is likely that the server URL that you specified is incorrect.</p>

            <title nested="2">App Install Errors</title>
            <description>
                <p>On some devices, an error can occur when installing an app from the Alpha Anywhere Classic Application Server (as opposed to the Alpha Anywhere Server for IIS or Alpha Cloud) if the app has a large number of files. The Classic Application Server limits the number of files that can be simultaneously served. On some devices, such as Android devices, the device tries to download all files simultaneously, exceeding the capacity of the Classic Application Server.</p>
                <p>To resolve this issue, change the *[ui:Download type]* to 'singleWithHeader'.</p>
                <p>This error does not occur if you are using the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS or Alpha Cloud.</p>
            </description>
            <note>
                <p>The *[ui:Download type]* option 'singleWithHeader' is only available for Alpha Launch V2.0.0.</p>
                <p>For older versions of Alpha Launch, you can work around this problem by copying the folder that contains your app files to a bucket on Amazon S3. When configuring the Alpha Launch profile, set the *[ui:Download location]* for the app to the URL of the S3 bucket to specify the application's files should be downloaded from Amazon S3 and not the Application Server.</p>

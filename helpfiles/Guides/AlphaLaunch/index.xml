    <description>AlphaLaunch allows you to install mobile Alpha Anywhere apps to Apple and Android devices without PhoneGap build or an AppStore.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>AlphaLaunch is a free AppStore app available for Android or Apple devices. Alpha Anywhere applications can be downloaded and installed within AlphaLaunch. Applications deployed to AlphaLaunch do not need to go through the Apple or Android App stores. Apps deployed to AlphaLaunch also do not require a PhoneGap build account. Alpha Anywhere mobile apps are installed into AlphaLaunch, not directly to the device. This makes it extremely easy and quick to install new Apps on a device.</p>

                <title>Publishing Apps to a Device using AlphaLaunch</title>
                <description>
                    <p>Publishing mobile apps to an App store (especially the Apple App store) can be a time consuming and frustrating experience. With AlphaLaunch you can quickly and easily publish mobile apps to Apple and Android devices, completely bypassing the App stores and PhoneGap Build.</p>
                    <p>In this video we show how you can publish an App to a device using AlphaLaunch.</p>

                <p>The use cases for AlphaLaunch include:</p>

            <list bullet="true">
                <item>
                    <name>You are developing a mobile App for a client and you want the client to be able to install and test the App on their own device</name>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>Organizations that need to create many 'employee-facing' applications and need a quick way to deploy these applications to their user community</name>

                <item>
                    <name>You want a quick and easy way to update previously installed Apps on a device without having to wait for App store approval.</name>

            <description>
                <p>Once an App has been installed into AlphaLaunch it operates largely identically to the way in which it would operate had it been installed directly on the device. For example, even when there is no internet connection, you will be able to start any App that is installed in AlphaLaunch.</p>
                <p>AlphaLaunch is not suitable as a means of deploying a public facing App that will be installed by many users who will go to the App store to find and install your App. When an App is installed directly onto a device the App icon will appear on the device's home screen. However, when you publish to AlphaLaunch, the App will not have an icon on the home screen. To launch the App you will first have to open AlphaLaunch and select the App from the list of Apps installed in AlphaLaunch.</p>
            </description>
            <note>Apps installed in AlphaLaunch are PhoneGap applications (even though you did not have to go through the PhoneGap build process) and they can use any of the PhoneGap plugins that AlphaLaunch exposes. For more information see [Understanding AlphaLaunch Limitations].</note>
        </section>
        <section>
            <note>On Apple devices, there are other ways that you can allow a user to test an App that you are developing using the Apple Test Flight system. However, setting up Test Flight is complex. Alternatively, you could get the UDID of a user's device and use a special Apple publishing profile with PhoneGap build that allows Apps that you build to be installed on that user's device  (without having to submit the App to the App store). However, this too, is complex and you are limited to only 100 devices.</note>

                <p>To publish Apps to AlphaLaunch open the Web Control Panel and select the project that contains the Apps that you want to publish.</p>
            </description>
            <note>
                <p>An 'App' is a UX component. The UX component can call child UX components, but these child UX components should typically be configured as Precomputed so that they can load directly from the device (so as not to be dependent on an Internet connection).</p>

By checking the Advanced mode property, you  have complete control over the template. The template can include special placeholders (e.g. {name} and {desc} ) to show the App name and description. If you want to use a default template style, do not check the Advanced mode property. You will then be able to select the App icon and background color of the row for this App in the list of installed Apps.</description>

                    <name>Download location</name>
                    <description>If you leave this property blank, the App files are download from a folder in the webroot of your Alpha Anywhere server. However, you can download the App files from another server if you wish. For example, you might want to have AlphaLaunch download the App files from Amazon S3. In this case you would enter the URL of the bucket on S3 where you have placed the App files. For example: http://mys3account.s3.amazonaws.com/app1. For more information on why you might want to specify another server (such as S3) as the download location see App Install Errors below.</description>

                <p>Once you have registered all of the Apps in a Web Project that you want to publish to AlphaLaunch you are now almost ready to publish to AlphaLaunch.</p>
                <p>But before you can publish you must first define a Publishing Profile that indicates where the Apps will be published (i.e. the Alpha Anywhere server and folder on that server where the Apps will be published). To define a publishing profile, click the Profiles button on the toolbar when the Web Project Control Panel has focus.</p>

            </figure>
            <note>Each Web Project will typically be published to its own AlphaLaunch server address. For example, you may have 3 UX components in 'Web Project1' that you want to publish to AlphaLaunch and (say) 2 UX components in 'Web Project2' that you want to publish to AlphaLaunch. In both cases you may want to use the same physical Alpha Anywhere server. The Publishing Profile that you define for 'Web Project1' might specify that you want to publish to a folder called 'webProject1', in which case the server address for the 3 Apps in this group of Apps might be something like 'http://www.myAAserver/webProject1'. On the other hand, the Publishing Profile you define for 'Web Project2' might specify that you want to publish to a folder called 'webProject2', in which case the server address for the 2 Apps in this group of Apps might be something like 'http://www.myAAserver/webProject2'.</note>

                <p>This will bring up the Publish to AlphaLaunch dialog. You will need to select the Publishing Profile to use and you will also need to specify the Server URL (i.e. the url of the location where the Apps are being published).</p>
                <p>Once you have published your Apps you will need to register the server in AlphaLaunch. AlphaLaunch will contact the server to get a list of the available Apps.</p>
                <p>For instructions on how to register a server with AlphaLaunch, see [How to Register a New AlphaLaunch Server]. To make it easy to register a new AlphaLaunch server (i.e. to avoid having to type in a long server URL on a mobile device keyboard), you will probably want to generate a QR code with with server address. Check the *[ui:Show a QR code...]* property before you click the OK button.</p>

                <p>You can use Advanced mode when you want to republish to AlphaLaunch after having made a change to the App settings (e.g. the App template, description, version number, etc.), but not the App itself. This will speed up the process of publishing the Apps because it will avoid having to recreate the static fileset for each App.</p>

            <title>Publishing AlphaLaunch App Files to Amazon S3</title>
            <description>
                <p>By default, when you publish an App to AlphaLaunch, the AlphaLaunch client (i.e. the App running on the mobile device) will download the App from the same folder to which the App was published. The App will be published to a folder in the webroot of the standard Alpha Anywhere server, the Alpha Anywhere IIS server, or AlphaCloud.</p>
                <p>However, you can also publish the app to a S3 bucket and when the AlphaLaunch user tries to install a new App, the App files will be downloaded from S3, rather than from your Alpha Anywhere server. Of course, once the user actually starts using the App on their device, Ajax callbacks will be handled by your Alpha Anywhere server.</p>
                <p>The benefit of downloading Apps from S3 is that you offload work from your Alpha Anywhere server to S3. Also, in certain cases, when using an Android device and downloading an App from an Alpha Anywhere standard server, the install might fail because the App has too many files. By using S3 as the download location, you can circumvent this problem.</p>
                <p>If you want to publish the App to S3, check the *[ui:Use Amazon S3 as download site for AlphaLaunch Apps]* checkbox on the Publish to AlphaLaunch dialog.</p>

            <title>Adding an Exit Button to your App</title>
            <description>
                <p>When an App is run in AlphaLaunch you will typically want to add an 'Exit' button to your App to go back to the AlphaLaunch home screen. If you do not add an Exit button, then after the user launches the App they will not be able to get back to the AlphaLaunch home screen to launch a different App.</p>
                <p>You can use Action Javascript to add an Exit button, or you can code the Javascript for the button yourself.</p>
                <p>To use Action Javascript, select the 'AlphaLaunch Actions' action for the list of available Action Javascript actions.</p>
                <p>To code the Javascript directly, use this code:</p>
            </description>
            <example code="js"><![CDATA[if(A5.shell) {A5.shell.exitComponent();};]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p>The code tests if you are running in AlphaLaunch, then if you are then it calls the *[js:A5.shell.exitComponent()]* method.</p>

            <title>Troubleshooting</title>
            <description>
                <p>The most common problem with AlphaLaunch is that after you have published Apps to your AlphaLaunch server and you then go to AlphaLaunch to install the Apps you just published, the Apps are not listed on the Apps to Install screen. This cause of this problem is either the Application Server has not been started, or the Server Address (i.e. URL) that was entered in the Publish to AlphaLaunch dialog was incorrect.</p>
                <p>You can test if you entered a valid server address by going to a browser and entering the following URL into the browser</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[<server URL>/availableAppInfo.txt]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p> For example, if your server URL was entered as:</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[http://192.168.70.157/AlphaLaunchDemo]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p>You would enter this address into the browser address bar:</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[http://192.168.70.157/AlphaLaunchDemo/availableAppInfo.txt]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p>If you do not receive a response, then it is likely that the server URL that you specified is incorrect.</p>

            <title nested="2">App Install Errors</title>
            <description>
                <p>If you are installing an App from a folder on an Alpha Anywhere standard server (as opposed to the Alpha Anywhere Server for IIS), you might get an install error if the App has a large number of files. This is because the Alpha Anywhere server limits the number of files that can be simultaneously served. The error will not occur if you are using the Alpha Anywhere server for IIS. You can work around this problem by copying the folder that contains your App files to a bucket on Amazon S3 and then setting the *[ui:Download location]* for the App to the URL of this S3 bucket.</p>

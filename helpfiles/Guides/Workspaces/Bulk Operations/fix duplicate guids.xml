    <topic>Find components with duplicate GUIDs</topic>
    <description>Lists components with duplicate GUIDs in the workspace. GUID duplication can occur if you duplicate an existing component in the workspace outside the Alpha Anywhere IDE.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>Each component has a unique GUID. This GUID is assigned when a new component is created. The GUID is used to keep track of the component's backups. If you create a copy of a component in project using Windows Explorer or other external tool, the new component may have the same GUID as another.</p>
        <p>The *[ui:Find components with duplicate GUIDs]* will search the project for components with duplicate GUIDs. If any components are found with duplicate GUIDs, you will need to assign a new GUID to one of the components.</p>
    </discussion>
    <tip>
        <p>To prevent duplicate GUIDs, only duplicate components using Alpha Anywhere's *[ui:Duplicate]* tool, which can be found by right-clicking a component on the Web Projects Control Panel.</p>

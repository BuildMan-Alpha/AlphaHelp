    <description>Bulk operation that enables 'Pre-render' option for all UX Components in the workspace.</description>
    <discussion>If you have a large number of UX components and you want to turn on the 'Pre-render at design-time' option for each UX component, opening each component, setting the property and then saving the component would be tedious. The *[ui:Turn 'Pre-render' option on for UX Components]* bulk operation automatically set this property in one or more UX components in a project. The bulk operation enables pre-rendering in the selected UX components.</discussion>

Enabling this option may make your component less secure. See [About Applying Security and Server-side Show/Hide Expressions on the Client] below.</p>

                <p>When applied *[ui:server-side]*, the controls that should not be visible to the user are *[physically removed]* from the HTML that is sent to the client.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, when applied *[ui:client-side]*, the computation about which controls should be hidden is still done *[ui:server-side]*, but the controls that should be hidden *[are still physically in the HTML]* and are *[hidden]* when the component is rendered. Therefore, *[ui:client-side]* option is *[less secure]* because a user might view the source on the page and see the data for the controls that have been hidden.</p>
            </description>
            <note>A UX component will not be converted to use the *[ui:pre-render]* option if it has security or server-side show/hide expressions and *[ui:Apply security and server-side show/hide expressions client-side]* is not enabled.</note>

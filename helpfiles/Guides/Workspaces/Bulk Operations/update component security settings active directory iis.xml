    <description>Bulk operation for updating the security settings for applications that use Active Directory or IIS.</description>
    <discussion>If an application was created before Alpha Anywhere 3.0 a bulk update operation to update component security needs to be run before the application can be published to IIS. To run this bulk update operation, select the web control panel, then "Edit" on the main menu, then "Bulk Operation", and then "Update component security settings (if using Active Directory or IIS)". The need to run this operation will be tracked. If this operation needs to be run, you will be prompted to do so at publish time.</discussion>

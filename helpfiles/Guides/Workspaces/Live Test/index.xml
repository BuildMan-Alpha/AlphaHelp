        <p>Live Test lets you run your app on the Development Server or Alpha Cloud, allowing you to test all or part of your app as if it were published to an Application Server.</p>
    </description>
    <discussion>
        <p>Live and Working Preview can be used to test a component within the development environment, however some Alpha Anywhere features such as the Security Framework do not run in the Preview environment. To test an app with Security -- such as login form or Administrator interface -- the app needs to run on the Application Server.</p>
        <p>Live Test is a tool that publish all or part of your application to the Development Server, IIS, or a temporary Alpha Cloud deployment, allowing you to fully test your app as if it were deployed to an Application Server.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Before you can Live Test your application, you need to create at least one .a5w page that contains the component(s) that compose your application. You can easily create an .a5w page for your app using the *[ui:Save Page]* button in the UX or Grid builder. Tabbed UI components automatically generate an .a5w page when created.</p>
                <p>Once you've created an .a5w page, you can Live Test your app:</p>

                </step>
                <step>
                    <description>
                        <p>Select the .a5w page that contains your app or the portion of your app you want to test.</p>

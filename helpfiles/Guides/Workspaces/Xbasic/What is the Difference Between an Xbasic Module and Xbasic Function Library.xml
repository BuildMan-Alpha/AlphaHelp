    <topic>What is the Difference Between an Xbasic Module and an Xbasic Function Library?</topic>
    <description>While an Xbasic Function Library and Xbasic Module may seem to be the same thing, the two Xbasic constructs have several key differences.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p> On the surface an Xbasic Function Library and an Xbasic Module seem similar in that they are both files in which you can define multiple Xbasic functions. However, there are several key differences between the two approaches.</p>

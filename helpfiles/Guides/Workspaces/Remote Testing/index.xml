            <description>
                <p>The *[ui:hostname]* is used to construct the address of the Alpha Anywhere server running on the machine.</p>
                <p>When testing in the browser on the development system (the machine where the component is being developed), the hostname is typically *[ui:localhost]*. *[ui:localhost]* refers to the system on which the browser is running.</p>
                <p>When testing on a remote device, *[ui:localhost]* cannot be used to create the address to the machine running Alpha Anywhere. An explicit hostname must be used.</p>
                <p>The explicit hostname can take several forms:</p>
            </description>
            <list bullet="true">
                <item>
                    <name>The machine's IP address. E.g. *[ui:192.70.80.23]*</name>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>A domain name. E.g. *[ui:www.mytestserver.com]*</name>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>The machine's name. E.g. *[ui:MYCOMPUTER]*</name>

                <p>If the mobile device is connected to the same network as the machine running the Alpha Anywhere sever,the machine name of the computer running the Alpha Anywhere server can be used to generate the hostname. In a home setting, this is often the case. However, in a work setting, this may not be the case.</p>
                <p>If the mobile device is not on the same network as the computer running Alpha Anywhere, connecting the mobile device to the network using a VPN (virtual private network) will allow the mobile device to see the computer.</p>
                <p>If the mobile device is not on the same network and VPN is unavailable, an IP address or domain name that is outside the network firewall must be used to connect to the system running Alpha Anywhere.</p>

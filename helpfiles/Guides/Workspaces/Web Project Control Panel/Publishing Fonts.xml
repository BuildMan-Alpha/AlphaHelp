    <description>In some cases the server on which your application is running may not have installed a font used in one of your reports. You can publish missing fonts to the application server by creating a Fonts folder.</description>

        <p>To create a font folder, click on the *[ui:More...]* button on the Web Projects Control Panel and select the *[ui:Create 'Fonts' folder]* menu option. Any fonts you place in this folder will be automatically installed on the server when you print a report. This feature is especially useful on Alpha Cloud where you do not have the ability to specify what fonts each server has installed.</p>

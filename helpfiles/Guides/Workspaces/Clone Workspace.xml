                <p>When a workspace is cloned, a complete copy of all of the files is done, including the WEb Projects in the workspace. The cloned workspace is saved in a new directory with a new name, which is specified in the *[ui:Clone Workspace]* dialog. You can optionally specify that any files in the target directory should be deleted when the workspace is cloned.</p>

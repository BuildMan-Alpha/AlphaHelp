    <description>A Web Project Profile is used to publish the web application to the local webroot, a remote server or computer on a local area network (LAN), or to an IIS server. The properties you can configure in a Web Project Profile are listed below.</description>
    <discussion>This article lists all properties for all Web Project Profile publishing types. Some properties may not be available for the Web Project Profile you create. For example, a profile with a Publishing Type of *[ui:Publish Locally]* will have very few options available. Similarly, settings for configuring an IIS publishing profile will not be available for FTP or HTTP publishing types.</discussion>

                                <p>If you use the built-in FTP program, you can specify the 'Optimize' option which will zip all of the files to be published into a single file, then unpack the zip file on the server. This can be substantially faster than publishing individual files.</p>

                                <p>The Publish dialog has a checkbox for this option. Selecting this option will ONLY publish the selected file or files. Normal publishing automatically adds files such as embedded or linked components, support files such as images, CSS and JavaScript files, and other files such as system files for Ajax support to the list of selected files to publish.

                            <description>
                                <p>Published grid components do not include meta data that is needed to open the component in the Grid Builder. Therefore the published grid files found in the server webroot can not be edited in the Grid component Builder. This option will create a special data file with the component name and a '_a5wcmp_metadata' file extension that will then be published when the grid is published.</p>
                                <p>The special _a5wcmp_metadata file is not used by the web server, but can be converted into the original editable grid using an option '*[link:Create Grid Component From Meta Data File@web project control panel create grid from metadata]*' found in the Web Control Panel '*[ui:More...]*' drop down.</p>
                                <p>This option should only be turned off if there are backup copies of the original grids available outside of the development system.</p>
                            </description>
                            <note>The motivation behind publishing meta data files is so that if a developer no longer has access to the original grid component files (.a5wcmp files) from the Web Project Folder, but does have access to the published .a5wcmp files, they will still be able to edit the Grid component files in the Grid builder (as long as they also have access to the published meta data files - _a5wcmp_metadata). The published files for all other component types (i.e. other than Grids) can be edited in the development program component builders (and therefore it is not necessary to publish meta data files for these component types).</note>
                            <important>Existing Grid Components must be recalculated or edited and saved in order for them to generate a meta data file to be published. Use the *[link:Update Compiled Files for AJAX Grids@https://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/index?search=bulk%20operation%20update%20compiled%20ajax%20grids]* Bulk Update tool to recalculate all Grids. Be sure to choose the *[ui:Create new 'compiled' files for ALL Ajax grids]* option when updating the Grids.</important>

                    <description>In order to publish a web application to an Alpha Anywhere server using the HTTP method, you must configure the Alpha Anywhere server to allow HTTP publishing and create a publishing profile that uses the HTTP method. Watch the videos below to learn more:</description>
                    <note>Alpha Anywhere will reload security data and clear the UX Component cache after publish when using HTTP Publish.</note>

                <p>The shared styles are defined in a file called style.sass in the _sharedStyles folder. The shared styles can include SASS definitions.</p>
                <p>For example, if you define a CSS selector called .style1 in the [Project Folder]\css\_sharedStyles\style.sass file, this selector will be available in all components, regardless of what style sheet the component uses.</p>

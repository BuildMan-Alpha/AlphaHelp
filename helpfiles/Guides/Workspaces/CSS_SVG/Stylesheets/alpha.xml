    <topic>Alpha Stylesheet</topic>
    <description>The Alpha style (which is a 'version 4' style) uses SVG icons (as opposed to CSS Icons which 'version 3' styles - such as iOS7, AndroidLight and AndroidDark used).</description>

        <p>The Alpha style is primarily intended for use with UX components.</p>
        <p>When you select the Alpha style (or any 'version 4' style), the builder displays a prompt allows you to select the 'compact' version of the style. For mobile applications the standard version of the style is appropriate. For desktop web applications, you might find the standard version of the style to be too large. Selecting the compact version of the style will render the component using smaller text, buttons, icons, etc.</p>

            <title>Version 4 Styles vs Previous Versions</title>
            <description>A notable feature of the 'version 4' styles is the change in the naming convention for the CSS selectors. In 'version 3' and older style sheets, the CSS selectors include the style name in the selector. For example, in the iOS7 style sheet there is a selector called:</description>
            <example><![CDATA[iOS7Button]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>In 'version 4' style sheets, the CSS selectors do not include the style name. So, the CSS selector for a button is now simply</description>
            <example><![CDATA[button]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>As a result of this change, when using a 'version 4' style, it will not be possible to have a page with two different components, each of which uses a different 'version 4' style. On the other hand it will now be possible to dynamically change the style of a component from one 'version 4' style to another 'version 4' style without having to re-render the component.</description>

            <description>
                <p>When you use the 'Alpha' theme in a Grid component, the color for the toolbar icons in the Detail View makes them difficult to see.</p>

            <description>You can make the icons much clearer by applying some CSS to the SVG icons used in the toolbar. This is done by defining CSS in the *[ui:Local CSS definitions]* property:</description>
            <figure>
                <title>The Local CSS definitions property can be used to add or overwrite CSS classes used in the Grid Component.</title>

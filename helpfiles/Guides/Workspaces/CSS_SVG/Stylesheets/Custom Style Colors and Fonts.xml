    <topic>Customizing Style Colors and Fonts</topic>
    <description>Editing the colors and fonts used in a style has always been possible by editing the style sheet. For example, if you are using the iOS7 style, you could edit this style and customize all colors and fonts. </description>

        <p>However, if you edit the style, you create your own copy of the style. That means that if Alpha subsequently modifies this style (for example, by adding new CSS classes for some new control type that is added to the UX), your style will not see these new classes unless you manually add them to your copy of the style. </p>
        <p>Also, bringing up the style builder just to change one of the colors in the style seems like overkill.</p>

            <description>A new option is now available for 'version 3' (e.g. iOS7, AndroidDark, AndroidLight) and 'version 4' (e.g. Alpha) styles.  These styles use SASS variables to define the colors and fonts used in the stylesheet.</description>

                <p>When you edit the colors and fonts using this builder, you are not editing the base style sheet. Instead you are storing your adjustments to the style in a separate file. This means that if the style sheet is changed by Alpha, you will get all of the edits applied to the style by Alpha, and you will still get your color and font changes.</p>
                <p>To see the file in which your edits are stored click the Manage files hyperlink at the bottom of the dialog.</p>

            <note>
                <p>When you customize the colors and fonts for a style, the edits apply to all components in your project that use the style. So, even though you might be in UXComponent1 when you edit the colors, UXComponent2 (for example), if it uses the same style as UXComponent1, will get the same edits to the colors and fonts.</p>
                <p>If you want to delete the custom colors you have defined, open the editor, and click the Manage files hyperlink and then delete the styleTweaks.json file that contains the settings.</p>

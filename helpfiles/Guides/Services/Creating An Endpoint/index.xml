</description>
<discussion>
<p>It is possible to use A5W pages to define an enpoint that is consumed as a service, using JSON, XML, CSV text or whatever other data format
is convenient.   In addition to HTTP 'GET', an A5W page can also accept 'POST' requests</p>
<p>A Service Endpoint can be useful for pushing data to an Alpha Anywhere server from another
process on the same machine, or another machine on the network.</p>
<p>Security on a Service Endpoint needs to be implemented at the page level.</p>

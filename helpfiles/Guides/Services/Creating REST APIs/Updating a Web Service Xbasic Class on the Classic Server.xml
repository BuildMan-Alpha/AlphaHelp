    <topic>Updating a Web Service Xbasic Class on the Classic Server</topic>
    <description>Xbasic classes used to implement web services are not reloaded unless the Classic Application Server is restarted or the __AARegisterClasses.a5w page is called.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>If you have a web service that you publish to the Classic Application Server, and if you edit a function in the class that your service exposes the service will not reflect the edited function  until you exit and restart the server.</p>
        <p>Exiting and restarting the server is inconvenient and often impossible if you are publishing to a remote server.</p>
        <p>Xbasic classes can be reloaded using a system page called __AARegisterClasses.a5w. When you finish publishing your app to the Classic Server, run the __AARegisterClasses.a5w page to re-register all of your Xbasic classes. Your web service will then work as expected.</p>

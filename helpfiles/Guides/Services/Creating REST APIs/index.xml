    <description>Alpha Anywhere allows you to create your own REST APIs. REST APIs can be used to allow third party applications or other Alpha Anywhere applications to interact with your application, including providing access to workflows and processes you have built as well as allowing access to SQL databases. You can also consume REST services in your Alpha Anywhere applications.</description>

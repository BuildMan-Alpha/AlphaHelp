<h1>Web Services: SAP Web Service Clients</h1>


<h2><a name="section1_Overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>Alpha Anywhere has been used by some customers to connect to SAP web services.
This article summarizes experience gained in working with those customers.</p>

<div class="sectionNote">The following discussion assumes you have previous experience with SOAP Web Services and Alpha Anywhere.
If you have not read the help topic <a href="https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/documentation/index?search=soap%20service%20clients">SOAP Services</a> you may want to start there.</div>

<h2><a name="section1_Connecting">Connecting to SAP Web Services</a></h2>
<p>The appropriate binding and credential settings for SAP services appear to be the following:</p>

<pre class="codeSection">
DIM binding as System::ServiceModel::BasicHttpBinding
binding.Security.Mode = System::ServiceModel::BasicHttpSecurityMode::TransportCredentialOnly
binding.Security.Transport.ClientCredentialType = System::ServiceModel::HttpClientCredentialType::Basic

DIM endpoint as System::ServiceModel::EndpointAddress = new System::ServiceModel::EndPointAddress(ServiceURL)

DIM Client as MyNamespace::GetList_OutClient = new MyNamespace::GetList_OutClient(Binding, EndPoint)
Client.ClientCredentials.HttpDigest.AllowedImpersonationLevel.value__ =  3 ' Impersonation
Client.ClientCredentials.HttpDigest.ClientCredential.UserName = UserName
Client.ClientCredentials.HttpDigest.ClientCredential.Password = Password
Client.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName = UserName
Client.ClientCredentials.UserName.Password = Password
</pre>
<div class="sectionNote">ServiceURL, UserName and Password are assumed to be variables in the script that have been 
populated with the respective values.</div>


<h2><a name="section1_LongURL">SAP Uses a Very Long URL</a></h2>
<p>Most web services use a URL that ends with the name of the service.  
SAP Web Services pass a lot of information as query parameters.
Be sure those query parameters are preserved in the endpoint/Address used for your service call.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="codeSection" style="white-space: pre-wrap;white-space: -moz-pre-wrap !important;white-space: -pre-wrap;white-space: -o-pre-wrap;word-wrap: break-word;">
http://server.domain.com:51000/XISOAPAdapter/MessageServlet?senderParty=&senderService=BS_XXXX_Q&receiverParty=&receiverService=&interface=GetList_Out&interfaceNamespace=http://XXXX.com//XXXX/GetList/DR6001
</pre>

<h2><a name="section1_FunctionPerService">SAP Generates a Separate Service For Each Function</a></h2>
<p>Each function that is generated into a web service becomes a separate web service.</p>
<p>As a result, you will need to treat each function as a completely separate service with its own assembly and client initialization code.</p>


<h2><a name="section1_Timeouts">Watch for Timeouts</a></h2>
<p>In some environments, we have noticed issues with timeouts.</p>
<p>You can increase the default timeouts as shown below:</p>
<pre class="codeSection">
DIM binding as System::ServiceModel::BasicHttpBinding

binding.OpenTimeout    = new System::TimeSpan(0,0,10)    ' Connect
binding.ReceiveTimeout = new System::TimeSpan(0,0,20)    ' Inactivity
binding.SendTimeout    = new System::TimeSpan(0,1,0)     ' Write Operation
binding.CloseTimeout   = new System::TimeSpan(0,0,15)    ' Close Operation
</pre>

<h2><a name="section1_Nesting">SAP Request and Response Objects Tend to Nest</a></h2>
<p>In the typical request and response pattern discussed in the help topic <a href="https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/documentation/index?search=soap%20service%20clients#RequestResponse">SOAP Services</a>,
there is a class for the request and a class for the response.
The call takes the form Response = Client.Method(Request).</p>
<p>SAP web services tend to nest down an additional level, defining a property prefixed with "MT" as shown below. 
The data type of the the property value tends to have DT as a prefix.</p>
<pre class="codeSection">
' Create the request, response and client
DIM Request as ::MyService::GetList_OutRequest
DIM Response as ::MyService::GetList_OutResponse
Request.MT_GetList_Request = new ::MyService::DT_GetList_Request()
Request.MT_GetList_Request.RequestId = "1"

' Call the service
Response = Client.GetList_Out(Request)

' Check the call status
DIM ListResponse as ::MyService::DT_GetList_Response = Response.MT_GetList_Response

' If values returned are in an array, you can walk through the array as follows:
for i = 1 to ListResponse.Get.Count
    Items = Plants + ListResponse.Get.GetValue(1).Item + crlf()
next
</pre>

<h2><a name="section1_DateFields">Working with Date Fields</a></h2>

<p>An error can occur when passing datetime fields to an SAP service that defines an element as type xsd:datetime.
The SOAP UI format of the date (2017-01-25T13:21:32.8908456-06:00) is slightly different than the one generating the error (2018-02-02T18:25:23.793 
- note that in this case it has seven digits of fractional time whereas the reported SOAP error only has three).</p>

<p>Passing DateTime values to SAP from WCF clients is a known issue.  Here are a couple of links to related posts.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31725962/pass-net-datetime-value-to-sap-xsddate">Stack Overflow discussion</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://archive.sap.com/discussions/thread/3342876">SAP Discussion Thread</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The most effective workaround to this issue so far requires making a change to the WSDL file and regenerating the client.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Download and save the WSDL file by referencing the URL for the WSDL in a browser and saving the contents to a text file.</li>
<li><p>Edit the WSDL file, changing the field type of the offending element (Order_Date in this example) from "xsd:datetime" to "xsd:string".</p>
<pre class="codeSection">
&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;Order_Date&quot; type=&quot;<strong>xsd:string</strong>&quot; &gt;
    &lt;xsd:annotation&gt;
        &lt;xsd:appinfo source=&quot;http://sap.com/xi/TextID&quot;&gt;d8d78f827aae11e28b885c260a3a7662&lt;/xsd:appinfo&gt;
    &lt;/xsd:annotation&gt;
&lt;/xsd:element&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>Rebuild the WCF client from the new WSDL file using Dotnet::Services::GenerateWCFServiceFromWSDL().</p></li>
<li><p>In Xbasic code that assigns the field, replace the assignment of the current date as follows:</p>
<pre class="codeSection">
objHeader.Order_Date = now()
</pre>
<p><br/>becomes</p>
<pre class="codeSection">
objHeader.Order_Date = System::String::Format("{0:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZ}", now())
</pre>
<div class="sectionNote">In this example, we use "now()". The source may also be a datetime variable or datetime literal.</div>
</li>
</ol>

                    <p>A web application that uses a form to collect user credentials should run over HTTPS so that the credentials are encrypted when transmitted from the browser to the server.</p>

					A DBF file or SQL database will still be used for developing and testing of the application. This means you can develop and test the application 
					without having or needing to have access to the production Active Directory domain. The group names used during development and testing do need to 
					be the same as in the Active Directory. In fact, your application can be developed with groups names that make sense for your application. Then 
					Active Directory group names can be mapped to your application defined groups names in the publish profile. Create or edit the 
					publish profile settings for the production web server to configure the Active Directory server used in production. 
					Publish profile setting for development and test servers should use the custom DBF file or SQL database.</p>

							<p>While users and groups are now used through Active Directory, developing and testing the web application against a production Active Directory server can be impractical because you may not have access to the Active Directory server. For this reason, you will want to create users and groups to be stored in a DBF file or SQL database.  These users and groups will be used during development and [testing].</p>
							<p>In order to work in this way, the name of the groups you want to secure against must be spelled the same way as they are stored in the Active Directory. If you only have a few, you can manually enter the groups and add some users as members of the groups. Otherwise, you can import groups directly from Active Directory or from a file.</p>

                    Importing groups gives you the option to merge into existing groups (add group names not already in the list), overwrite existing groups (delete all groups before adding groups being imported), and include a test user in each group. 
                </description>
                <note>
                    As of build 2358, the format of the group name has changed. It is now prefixed with the domain name e.g. *[ACME\Human Resources]*. Groups that were imported or entered before build 2358 will need to be reimported or manually updated to include the domain prefix. This change is required to support integrated authorization under IIS.

                    <p>To import groups from a file, change the Group name source to "File". Then specify a file that has the name of each group on a separate line. A test user name can be include for the groups too. The test user name follows the group name on the same line. Two tab characters are included between the group name and the test user name. The format of the test user name is the test user's name followed by a | character and then the SAM-Account-Name for the test user. Example: *[xb:John Doe|jdoe]*</p>
                    <p>A command line tool named A5ActiveDirectoryExport.exe is included in the Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition installation for generating a file from an Active Directory that can be imported into the Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition.

                <description>
                    <p>When testing and developing a web application, it is necessary to validate user authorization to parts of the application. For instance, the web application may have a back office component that should only be available to users in the "web app administrator" group. This is why users can still be defined in the web project's security settings. When publishing to a test environment, instead of defining an Active Directory configuration, publish the Alpha Anywhere security tables so that they will be used for authentication and authorization instead of Active Directory. This gives the ability to accurately test authorization. </p>
                </description>
                <note>If your test environment includes a test Active Directory domain, you can define an Active Directory configuration to use the test Active Directory domain in your publish profile for the test environment.</note>

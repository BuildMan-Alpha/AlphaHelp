            <title>How do I Install and Configure the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS?</title>
            <description>To install the Application Server for IIS, you must install several components: IIS, Web Deploy, and the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS. See the [IIS Installation Guide] for more information.</description>

        <section>
            <title>How do I Publish my Application to IIS?</title>
            <description>An application requires an IIS Publish profile to publish the application to the Application Server for IIS. See [Getting Started with IIS] and [Create a Publish Profile (for IIS)] for more information about how to publish to IIS and the options available for configuring an IIS Publish profile.</description>

            <title>How do I stop the Application Pool(s) so I can install an update for the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS?</title>
            <description>When installing an update for the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS, both all application pools for published Alpha Anywhere applications must be stopped to avoid a system reboot after installing the update. Stopping application pools can be done through the IIS Manager. For more information on how to stop an application pool, see [How to Stop IIS Application Pools].</description>

            <title>Why am I getting HTTP 4xx and 5xx errors?</title>
            <description>HTTP 4xx and 5xx errors indicate a problem with the client (requested missing resource, incorrect security configuration, etc) or the server (Xbasic error, overloaded server, server timeouts.) [HTTP status codes] of 400 and above can be diagnosed using *[Failed Request Tracing]*. Tracing will log additional information about the error. See [Tracking Down Request Failures] to learn how to enable tracing.</description>

            <title>How do I preserve Custom Modifications to the web.config file?</title>
            <description>
                <p>The web.config file is generated from the profile settings every time an Alpha Anywhere application is published. If you have added features to your site, such as HTTP redirect settings, these settings will be lost if *[ui:Preserve web.config Elements]* is not enabled in the IIS Publish profile. See [Create a Publish Profile] for more information about *[ui:Preserve web.config Elements]*.</p>

            <title>Why do I receive an error that the web.config file is too large?</title>
            <description>
                <p>The default maximum size of a web.config file is 250kb. This issue is typically encountered if web security data is published to the web.config file.</p>
                <p>You can work around this limitation by setting two registry values. See [Publish error when web.config file is too large] for complete instructions on how to configure the registry to allow for larger web.config files.</p>

	<h1>Create a Publish Profile</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
		Creating a publish profile for publishing to the Application Server for IIS is done using a Genie in the same 
		manner as is done for creating a publish profile to the stand-alone Application Server.
		</p>
	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
			An IIS server must be configured to allow publishing to it. See the 
			<a href="../Installation/index.xml#group_Publish Directly to IIS">Publish Directly to IIS</a> section
			in the <a href="../Installation/index.xml">Installation Guide</a> for details on configuring IIS to 
			allow publishing.
			</li>

			<li>
			If publishing to a local IIS server (IIS is running on the same machine that is running the Developer Edition) you 
			will need to ensure that Web Deployment Agent Service is installed and running. This can be checked in the Windows 
			services control panel:
			<p>
				<a href="images/services-control-panel.png">
					<img src="images/services-control-panel.png" alt="Windows services control panel with Web Deployment Agent Service highlighted."></img>
				</a>
			</p>
			If "Web Deployment Agent Service" is missing, go to the Windows Control Panel - Programs and Features, find Microsoft Web Deploy 3.5, 
			right click and then select change. Go to the next wizard page and you'll then need to click the Change button. 
			Make sure the Remote Agent Service feature is installed.

			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	<h2>Create Publish Profile Genie</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Open the profile dialog by clicking on the Profiles toolbar button.
				<p>
					<a href="images/profiles-button.png">

				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			Click on the Add New Profile button.

				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			Select the IIS type radio button

					<a href="images/iis-publish-type.png">
						<img src="images/iis-publish-type.png" alt="IIS publish type radio button."></img>
					</a>
				</p>

			<li>
			Configure IIS server publish settings

						<img src="images/iis-genie-1.png" alt="IIS server publish settings."></img>
					</a>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>IIS publish type</h3>
						The only option currently available is "Direct" which means the development machine
						must be able to connect to the IIS server.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>IIS management service URL</h3>
						In most cases the IIS management service is configured with the default settings so this value is 
						the host address to the IIS server like localhost, 127.0.0.1, or www.mysite.com. If IIS management
						service is installed with non-default values, the entire management service URL is needed such as
						https://www.mysite.com:8172/MsDeploy.axd.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Use integrated Windows authentication</h3>
						Using the IIS management service requires an authenticated connection. Check this option to connect as the user
						you are currently logged in as on the development machine. 
						<a name="user-requirements">
							<div class="sectionNote">The user that connects to the IIS management service <b>must</b> be a local machine 
							administrator on the machine that the IIS server is installed on. Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS 
							<b>must</b> also be configured to allow this user, or a group this user belongs to, to publish to IIS by way
							of the "Direct Publishing" feature in IIS Manager. See the 
							<a href="../Installation/index.xml#group_Publish Directly to IIS">Publish Directly to IIS</a> section in the 
							Installation Guide for more details.</div>
						</a>
						<div class="sectionNote">When using integrated Windows authentication to publish to a local IIS server you must run 
						Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition as administrator since this requires elevated privleges on the local system. To run
						Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition with elevated privleges, right click on the Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition icon 
						and select Run as Administrator.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Username</h3>
						Enter a user name that is a local machine administrator on the IIS server machine and is allowed to publish
						to IIS (see <a href="#user-requirements">note above</a>) when integrated Windows authentication is not being used.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Password</h3>
						Password for the above user name.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Confirm password</h3> 
						Re-enter password.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Ignore HTTPS certificate errors</h3>
						User credentails are passed to the IIS server using basic HTTP authetication. The connection is secured using HTTPS, 
						but the default certificate that is used is a self-signed certificate which is typically not trusted. This will cause
						publish authentication to fail unless a trusted certificate is set in the IIS management server configuration. 
						Alternatively, check this option to ignore when a certificate is untrusted.
						<div class="sectionWarning">
						This option should only be selected when publishing to a non-production IIS server. A production IIS server should
						have its IIS management service configured with an appropriate certificate.
						</div>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
			Configure IIS site and application settings
				<p>
					<a href="images/iis-genie-2.png">
						<img id="iis-genie-2" src="images/iis-genie-2.png" alt="IIS and application settings."></img>
					</a>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Site name</h3>
						Enter the site name as it is labeled in IIS Manager. This name is independent of the DNS name for the site. 
						The initial site that IIS sets up is named "Default Web Site" and that is also the default value for this
						setting. If the site doesn't exist, pubilsh will create the site.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Application name</h3>
						More than one application can be hosted in a site. This is left blank by default to have the application published
						as the "default" application for the site. Applications are loaded by using the application name 
						in the requested URL's path. When no path is used in the URL and only the host name is used the "default" 
						application is used. For example, if a user enters https://www.mysite.com/ into a browser the default page
						for the default application will be returned. But, if a user enters https://www.mysite.com/purchasing into a 
						browser, the default page for the "purchasing" application will be returned. In most cases the desired behavior 
						is to have an application available by only entering the host name so leave this prompt empty.
					</li>
					<li>
						<script>
						function showAdvancedSettings(e) {
							e.preventDefault();
							var el = document.getElementById("iis-genie-2");
							el.src = "images/iis-genie-2.png";
							setTimeout(function() {
								el.scrollIntoView(true);
								el.src = "images/iis-publish-advanced.gif";
							}, 0);
						}
						</script>
						<h3>Advanced Settings</h3>
						Click on <a href="" onclick="showAdvancedSettings(event);">Advanced Settings</a> to show the advanced settings.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Use custom physical path</h3>
						This setting is only needed if sites and applications need to be published to specific paths on the 
						IIS server. This is typically not needed. Any new sites will default to being stored in the path c:\inetpub.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Show error detail in remote responses</h3>
						If an error occurs during a page request detailed error messages including stack traces are not sent back in the
						response when the request comes from a remote client (a client that is not on the same machine as the IIS server).
						The errors messages and stack traces are logged. However, during application development it may be more convenient 
						to have this information returned in the response instead. Check this setting to allow this information to be
						return in a response.
						<div class="sectionWarning">Sensitive information may be included in error messages and stack traces that may
						make the site vunerable to attack. This option should be disabled when publishing to a production server.
						Error messages and stack traces are stored in logs so this option should not be needed on a production server. If
						it is used on a production server, it should only be used for the needed duration and then disabled.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Preserve web.config Elements</h3>
						Each time an application is published a new web.config file is generated from the profile settings, web project
						security settings, and the web project properties. This web.config file will overwrite the web.config file on 
						the IIS server. The web.config file on the IIS server may contain configuration changes that are not accounted for
						by the profile settings, web project security settings, or the web project properties. This could include settings
						like HTTP redirect. These settings need to be preserved when the new web.config file is generated. This feature
						allows that to be done.
						
						<div class="sectionNote">This feature assumes familiarity with XML files, XML namespaces, and XPath.</div>
						
						To preserve settings in a web.config file on an IIS server the XPath to the element needs to be found for that 
						setting in the web.config file. The following example uses the HTTP redirect feature. Here is a sample web.config
						file:

						<div class="codeTable codeTableArea">&lt;configuration&gt;
.
.
.
  &lt;system.webServer&gt;
    .
    .
    .
    &lt;httpProtocol&gt;
      &lt;customHeaders&gt;
        &lt;remove name="X-Powered-By" /&gt;
        &lt;add name="X-Powered-By" value="Alpha Anywhere Application Server" /&gt;
      &lt;/customHeaders&gt;
    &lt;/httpProtocol&gt;
    <span class="codeLineHighlight">&lt;httpRedirect enabled="true" destination="https://www.mysite.com/" httpResponseStatus="Permanent" /&gt;</span>
  &lt;/system.webServer&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</div>
						The XPath to the HTTP redirect setting is <span style="font-family: monospace">/configuration/system.webServer/httpRedirect</span>.
						This gets entered into the XPath list.
						<p>
							<a href="images/preserve-web-config.png">
								<img src="images/preserve-web-config.png" alt="Preserve web.config dialog with XPath to HTTP redirect element."></img>
							</a>
						</p>
						The next example demonstrates a set more complicated elements. Here's the example web.config file.
						<div class="codeTable codeTableArea">&lt;configuration&gt;
  <span class="codeLineHighlight">&lt;configSections&gt;
    &lt;sectionGroup name="common"&gt;
      &lt;section name="logging" type="Common.Logging.ConfigurationSectionHandler, Common.Logging, Version=3.3.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=af08829b84f0328e"/&gt;
    &lt;/sectionGroup&gt;
    &lt;section name="nlog" type="NLog.Config.ConfigSectionHandler, NLog, Version=3.2.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=5120e14c03d0593c"/&gt;
  &lt;/configSections&gt;</span>
  .
  .
  .
    &lt;httpProtocol&gt;
      &lt;customHeaders&gt;
        &lt;remove name="X-Powered-By" /&gt;
        &lt;add name="X-Powered-By" value="Alpha Anywhere Application Server" /&gt;
      &lt;/customHeaders&gt;
    &lt;/httpProtocol&gt;
  &lt;/system.webServer&gt;
  <span class="codeLineHighlight">&lt;common&gt;
    &lt;logging&gt;
      &lt;factoryAdapter type="Common.Logging.NLog.NLogLoggerFactoryAdapter, Common.Logging.NLog32, Version=3.3.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=af08829b84f0328e"&gt;
        &lt;arg key="configType" value="INLINE"/&gt;
      &lt;/factoryAdapter&gt;
    &lt;/logging&gt;
  &lt;/common&gt;
  &lt;nlog <a name="custom-namespace"><span class="codeElementHighlight">xmlns="http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd"</span></a> xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"&gt;
    &lt;targets&gt;
       &lt;target name="logfile" xsi:type="File" archiveAboveSize="1000000" autoFlush="true" layout="${longdate} ${uppercase:${level}} ${message}" createDirs="true" enableFileDelete="true" fileName="c:\Temp\${date:format=yyyy-MM-dd}-pgprovider.log" /&gt;
       &lt;target name="eventlog" xsi:type="EventLog" layout="${message}" log="Application" source="Garbio pgProvider" /&gt;
    &lt;/targets&gt;
    &lt;rules&gt;
       &lt;logger name="*" minlevel="Trace" writeTo="logfile" /&gt;
       &lt;logger name="*" minlevel="Trace" writeTo="eventlog" /&gt;
    &lt;/rules&gt;
  &lt;/nlog&gt;
  &lt;runtime&gt;
    &lt;loadFromRemoteSources enabled="true" /&gt;
    &lt;assemblyBinding xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1"&gt;
      &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;
        &lt;assemblyIdentity name="Common.Logging" publicKeyToken="af08829b84f0328e" culture="neutral" /&gt;
        &lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-3.3.1.0" newVersion="3.3.1.0" /&gt;
      &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;
      &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;
        &lt;assemblyIdentity name="NLog" publicKeyToken="5120e14c03d0593c" culture="neutral" /&gt;
        &lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-3.2.0.0" newVersion="3.2.0.0" /&gt;
      &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;
    &lt;/assemblyBinding&gt;
  &lt;/runtime&gt;</span>
&lt;/configuration&gt;</div>

					This example shows the need for correct ordering of XPath to elements and shows the use of a 
					<a href="#custom-namespace">custom namespace</a> (shown in bold with a red, dashed border in the example).
					<p>
					The image that follows shows the settings needed to preserve the highlighted sections in the example.
					</p>
					<p>

						</a>
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
						<h4>&lt;configSections&gt; element</h4>
						The example shows that XPaths are included for <span class="HTML1">&lt;sectionGroup name="common"&gt;</span> and 
						<span class="HTML1">&lt;section name="nlog"&gt;</span> which are the only sub-elements of <span class="HTML1">&lt;configSections&gt;</span>.
						It might seem to make sense to only include an XPath for <span class="HTML1">&lt;configSections&gt;</span>, but a 
						<span class="HTML1">&lt;configSections&gt;</span> element may be already be in the generated web.config file.
						This generated element and its sub-elements would be replaced if only the XPath for 
						<span class="HTML1">&lt;configSections&gt;</span> was used, and the generated sub-elements would be lost. 
						This is why each sub-element is listed in the XPath separately.
						</li>
						<li>
						<h4>XPath order</h4>
						The order of the XPaths in the list is significant so that the elements to be preserved can be positioned correctly in the 
						newly generated web.config file. In this example, <span class="HTML1">&lt;sectionGroup name="common"&gt;</span>
						is before <span class="HTML1">&lt;section name="nlog"&gt;</span> so the XPath for the sectionGroup element 
						(<span class="Code1">/configuration/configSections/sectionGroup[@name='common']</span>) needs to be 
						listed before the XPath for the section element (<span class="Code1">/configuration/configSections/section[@name='nlog']</span>). 
						In the same way, the XPath <span class="Code1">/configuration/common</span> must be listed before the XPath 
						<span class="Code1">/configuration/myNlog:nlog</span>.
						</li>
						<li>
						<h4>Custom namespace</h4>
						This example has an element that defines a <a href="#custom-namespace">namespace</a> by using the 
						<span class="HTML1">xmlns</span> attribute. The namespace must be defined 
						with a prefix name in order to be able to write an XPath that will find this element. The prefix name can be anything
						and is only used by the XPath expression. In this example, the prefix MyNlog is defined for the 
						<span class="Code1">http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd</span> namespace and the prefix is subsequently
						used in the <span class="Code1">/configuration/myNlog:nlog</span> XPath. A namespace only needs to be defined
						with a prefix if it is needed in an XPath.

			<a name="overview"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
			<div class="sectionNote">This document is a work in progress.</div>
			<p>
			</p>

			<a name="differences-under-iis"><h2>Differences between IIS and the stand-alone server</h2></a>
			<p>
				This section contains information about features an application running on the stand-alone server may use
				that could behave differently under IIS and what you can do to get those features working under IIS. Not all 
				applications use these features so these may not apply to your application.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Security data is stored differently on IIS</h4>
					<p>
						This feature will affect most applications. Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS uses ASP.NET's 
						membership and role providers for authentication and authorization. Membership and role providers are 
						abstract interfaces. These abstract interfaces are a consistent API across implementations. The same interface
						is used with a membership provider implemented for SqlServer as is used for a membership provider
						implemented for MySQL. Each implementation is free to store security data in any way it sees fit. 
						This implementation detail (the persistence of security data) is hidden from the application using the
						membership and/or role provider. An Alpha Anywhere application running under IIS uses providers supplied by
						the choosen database vendor. These providers do not use the Alpha Anywhere Application Server's schema for 
						security data. This means security data must be migrated to the schema used by the database vendor's 
						provider. See more details in the <a href="#migrate-security-data">Migrate Security Data</a> section.
					</p>
					<p>
						This also affects how you develop and maintain an application with security. When users and groups are defined 
						in the Web Security settings in Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition there are two options for storing the users and
						groups: DBF and SQL Database. When SQL Database is selected, users and groups of a production application
						can be mananged through the Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition or by pages in the application that are usually
						restricted administrator level users.
						This is no longer the case with IIS since a deployed application's security data is stored in IIS provider 
						specific database tables. The users and groups stored in the DBF or SQL Database are published to the IIS provider
						specific database tables at application publish time or by way of the "Publish Security Files" feature in the 
						Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition Web Security control panel. Day to day user management (such as adding users, 
						disabling users, resetting passwords, and adding users to groups) needs to be done by administrator level pages 
						in the application. Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition has built-in security components that can be used for 
						creating pages for managing users. An application can also use methods and properties on the 
						<a href="http://downloads.alphasoftware.com/a5v12Download/ReleaseNotes/ContextObject/context.html#Security">Context.Security object</a>
						for managing users and groups within the application.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Authorization works with a slight difference on IIS</h4>
					<p>
					This difference is abstracted away by Alpha Anywhere. Any appliacations created with Alpha Anywhere 3.0 
					or later do not require any change. If an application was created before Alpha Anywhere 3.0 a bulk update 
					operation to update component security needs to be run before the application can be published to IIS. To run
					this bulk update operation, select the web control panel, then "Edit" on the main menu, then "Bulk Operation", and
					then "Update component security settings (if using Active Directory or IIS)". The need to run this operation will 
					be tracked and if this operation needs to be run you will be prompted to do so at publish time.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Web server process runs under a virtual account on IIS</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h5>File/folder access</h5>
							This difference will most notably affect file/folder access. An application pool will be set to run as 
							<a href="http://www.iis.net/learn/manage/configuring-security/application-pool-identities">"Application Pool Identity"</a>
							by default. This means that IIS will create	a virtual account and this account has minimal access. It will have access 
							to read and execute from the web root and have access write to a temporary folder. If an application writes to the
							web root, to folders outside of web root, reads files outside of the web root the application will be denied access 
							to those folders under IIS. The virtual account must be given the needed access to these other folders, or the 
							application needs to be changed to do the work in a different way. Instead of giving access to specific virtual 
							account(s) access can be granted to the build in group IIS_IUSRS. This group includes all virtual accounts so 
							this option should not be used if multiple applications on the same server should not have access to each 
							other's files/folders.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>Connection strings that use Windows Authentication</h5>
							Connection strings that use Windows Authentication rather than a username and password will also be affected because
							the connection to the database will be done under the virtual account. That account or the machine the account is running
							on needs to be given access to the database. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>Mapped drives to shares</h5>
							Mapped drive settings are stored in a user's profile. An application pool by default does not load the user's profile.
							Additionally, a virtual account's user profile is very impractical and some times impossible to set. This means mapped
							drives won't be available for an application. Use UNC paths instead.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>Regional settings</h5>
							Regional settings are another user account setting. When Windows is first set up on a machine the default system 
							regional settings are configured. New user accounts inherit this setting. The application pool's virtual account 
							is created at the time the application pool is create and inherits regional settings from the original system
							regional settings. Windows may have originally been installed with English (United States) as the default regional 
							settings, so the virtual account will have its regional settings set to English (United States). This will happen
							even if an application pool is created by a user that has regional settings set to something else like Dutch (Belgium).
							To have a virtual account set to a different regional setting when it is created, you must change the default
							regional settings for system and new user accounts. Go to the Windows Control Panel "Clock, Language, and Region" 
							settings, click on the "Region" item, and then click on the "Administrative" tab. This tab has a "Copy settings..."
							button which can be used to copy the current user's regional settings to be the default for system accounts and new
							user accounts. Once this is done, a application will run with the expected regional settings.
							<p>
							<a href="images/default-regional-settings.png"><img src="images/default-regional-settings.png" alt="Windows regional settings dialog copy settings button."></img></a>
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

					An alternative solution to the above items is to manual create or set an application pool to use a specific user 
					that already has access to files, folder, or database servers. You may also need to set the application pool to 
					"Load User Profile" in the application pool's advanced settings dialog. 

					<p>
					<a href="images\load-user-profile.png"><img src="images\load-user-profile.png" alt="Load user profile set to true."></img></a>
					</p>
					IIS publish will not overwrite an existing application pool so you can specify the application
					pool name in the publish profile so your application will use this manually created application pool.
					<div class="sectionNote">
					If you do choose to create an application pool manually it must 
					be configured correctly to work with Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS. Here are the required settings. 
					They can be set in the application pool's "Advanced Settings" dialog. <br /><br />
						<ul>
							<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">.NET Framework Version</span> must be set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">v4.0</span>.</li>
							<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enable 32-Bit Appliations</span> must be set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">true</span>.</li>
							<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start Mode</span> should be set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">AlwaysRunning</span> (this will allow for quicker initial response from IIS).</li>
							<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Maximum Worker Processes</span> should be set to at least <span style="font-weight: bold;">5</span>.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>

					<h4>Password recovery is not supported on IIS</h4>
					The security configuration Data Recovery option "Lost password action" "Recover Password" is not supported
					on IIS.
					<p>
					<a href="images/recover-password.png"><img src="images/recover-password.png" alt="Recover password configuration option."></img></a>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Password reset when user forgot security question answer</h4>
					Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS does not directly manipulate security data in a database. It instead uses
					an API that third party providers like SqlServer and MySQL must implement. This created a need for an API that is
					available to an application developer to reset a user's password when the security configuration "Lost password action"
					is set to "Reset Password", an answer to a security question is required, and the user has forgotten the answer
					to the security question. Use the 
					<a href="http://downloads.alphasoftware.com/a5v12Download/ReleaseNotes/ContextObject/context.html#Security-AdministrativeResetPassword">Context.Security.AdministrativePasswordReset()</a> 
					method to do this. An a5w page or component that uses this method should only be accessible to administrator level 
					users.
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Legacy components are not supported on IIS</h4>
					Legacy dialog components will not work under IIS. They need to be converted before they will work under IIS.
					Right click on the legacy component in the Web Project control panel and then select the 
					"Create New Dialog component from the legacy Dialog component" menu item to do this conversion.
					<p>

			<a name="context-object"><h2>Using the Context object in server side code.</h2></a>
			<p>
			The <a href="http://downloads.alphasoftware.com/a5v12Download/ReleaseNotes/ContextObject/context.html">Context object</a> is 
			now the recommended way to interface with the server in server side code. The Context object is available anywhere server side
			code runs. This includes a5w pages and components. The Context object works the same whether an application runs under IIS or
			the stand-alone server and contains properties of the server and interfaces for the request, response, sesssion, and security
			of the running application. If any other web server platforms supported in the future, the Context object will support these 
			platforms too.

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>Security data (users, groups, and membership) are stored differently under IIS than under Alpha Anywhere Application Server. This means
				an application running under IIS cannot use the same security data as the application running under the Alpha Anywhere Application Server.
				When an application running in production under Alpha Anywhere Application Server is moved to IIS, the security data must be migrated
				to an IIS provider schema. The specific schema that is used by an IIS provider is defined by the provider. Alpha Anywhere Application Server 
				has a Genie in the server settings dialog to export security data and the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS has a utility named
				<span class="fixedfont">A5IISMigrateSecurityData.exe</span> to import security data in to an IIS provider.
				</p>
				<p>
				The following security data are migrated with steps that follow:
					<ul>
						<li>Users
						<ul>
							<li>Name</li>
							<li>Password</li>
							<li>Email Address</li>
							<li>Security Question</li>
							<li>Security Question Answer</li>
							<li>Locked Out
							<p class="sectionNote">A user may be locked out because of too 
							many failed log in attempts or because an application adminstrator has manually disabled the user. A user that is 
							locked out because of too many failed log in attempts is typically automatically reenabled after a period 
							of time. When a user in this state is migrated, the user is treated as if an application adminstrator has manually 
							disabled the user so the user must be manually reenabled by an application adminstrator.
							</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Groups (roles)
						</li>
						<li>Membership &ndash; The list of groups to which each user belongs.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			<h3>Security Data Migration Steps</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Create a publish profile to publish to an IIS server. Part of the publish profile includes configuring the 
						memberhip provider (for users) and role provider (for groups) to be used by the application. See the 
						<a href="http://downloads.alphasoftware.com/A5V12Download/ReleaseNotes/ProviderConfiguration/ProviderConfiguration.html">Provider Configuration</a>
						documentation for more information on choosing providers.
					</li>
					<li>
						Publish using the newly created publish profile. The publish dialog has an option to publish security data. This option
						will publish security data as defined in Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition. This data will not contain an accurate lock out status of 
						users since the lock out status data is kept on the production web server. Since you will be exporting data from the production
						server instead, choose the "Ignore - Do not publish users and roles." option. This option will define the membership and role 
						providers in the published application. This is needed in order to import users, groups, and membership under IIS.
					</li>
					<li>
						Go to the application server settings dialog in Alpha Anywhere Application Server. This dialog is opened from the context menu 
						of the Alpha Anywhere Application Server tray icon.
						<p>
							<a href="images/tray.png"><img src="images/tray.png" alt="Alpha Anywhere Application Server tray icon context menu."></img></a>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Select the tab labeled &ldquo;<strong>Other</strong>&rdquo; and click on the &ldquo;<strong>Open the Users and Groups Migration Genie</strong>&rdquo; link.
						<p>
							<a href="images/other.png"><img src="images/other.png" alt="Alpha Anywhere Application Server users and groups migration genie link."></img></a>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						The <strong>User and Groups Migration Genie</strong> has an information section to explain its purpose. The information section contains a 
						checkbox labeled &ldquo;<strong>Migrate a web application's security data</strong>&rdquo;. This check box will need to be selected
						in order to continue with the rest of the genie.
						<p>
							<a href="images/genie.png"><img src="images/genie.png" alt="Alpha Anywhere Application Server users and groups migration genie."></img></a>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						After selecting the &ldquo;<strong>Migrate a web application's security data</strong>&rdquo; checkbox, the genie will scan the 
						application server for applications that have security data. Select an application and then choose a location for the exported
						data. The export process will also generate a key for securing sensitive data like passwords, and security questions and answers.
						This key will be stored in a file with a .key extension. If needed, this .key file can be kept apart from the data file making 
						it easier to move the data file securely to the IIS server. You will only need the .key file once the data file is on the IIS server 
						and you are ready to import the security data. You may also select to encrypt the entire security data file rather than just the 
						sensitive data in it.
						<p>
							<a href="images/ready-for-export.png"><img src="images/ready-for-export.png" alt="Alpha Anywhere Application Server users and groups ready for export."></img></a>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Click the &ldquo;<strong>Export Data</strong>&rdquo; button to begin the export. The export may take some time depending on the amount of users, 
						groups, and number of users assigned to groups. When the export is finished a Windows file explorer window will
						open to the folder with the .data and .key file and the .data file will be selected. Now the files can be moved to 
						the IIS server.
						<p>
							<a href="images/export-complete.png"><img src="images/export-complete.png" alt="Alpha Anywhere Application Server export complete."></img></a>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Use any means to move the .data file to the IIS server. If you do not want to move the .key file over a network you
						can copy it to a thumb drive and carry it to the IIS server. When you are ready to do the import copy the .key file 
						from the thumb drive into the same folder as the .data file.
					</li>
					<li>
						Now that the .data and .key files are on the IIS server the <strong><span class="fixedfont">A5IISMigrateSecurityData.exe</span></strong> utility can be used to import
						the security data. This utility is located in the installation folder which defaults to <span class="fixedfont">C:\Program Files (x86)\A5V12 Application Server for IIS</span>.
						This utility must be &ldquo;<strong>Run as adminstrator</strong>&rdquo; to ensure that it has access IIS application configurations.
						<p>
							<a href="images/run-as-administrator.png"><img src="images/run-as-administrator.png" alt="Alpha Anywhere A5IISMigrateSecurityData.exe."></img></a>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Enter or select the .data file name. If the entire file is encrypted the &ldquo;<strong>Inspect Security Data</strong>&rdquo;
						button can be used to review the security data before importing. Sensitive data (passwords, security questions and answers) 
						will still be encrypted.
						<p>
							<a href="images/select-security-file.png"><img src="images/select-security-file.png" alt="Alpha Anywhere Migrate Security Data select security file."></img></a>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Select the web application that you published in step 1. The web application has the connection string to the
						database for the security data. Depending on how the application is allowed to access the database alternate
						credentials may be needed to import the security. For instance, your application may not add new users so the
						database credential may only allow read access. In order to do the import write access is needed so alternate 
						credential will need to be supplied.
						<p>
							<a href="images/web-app.png"><img src="images/web-app.png" alt="Alpha Anywhere Migrate Security Data select web application."></img></a>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Select the import mode. &ldquo;<strong>Merge</strong>&rdquo; is non-destructive. All existing users and roles will remain unchanged. 
						There is a &ldquo;<strong>Replace</strong>&rdquo; option. This option is destructive. All existing users and roles will be deleted before adding new users and 
						roles so use caution choosing this option.
					</li>
					<li>
						Click on the Import button to begin the import. Progress will be shown as the import is being done. Progress is also
						logged and this log can be reviewed after the import is completed.
						<p>
							<a href="images/show-log.png"><img src="images/show-log.png" alt="Alpha Anywhere Migrate Security Data show import log."></img></a>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Run your application and test login and page access.
					</li>

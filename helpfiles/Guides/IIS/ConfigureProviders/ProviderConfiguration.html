<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
There are four extension points that Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS uses to handle authentication, authorization, session, and profile data.
These are defined in ASP.NET as the following providers:
<ul>
  <li>
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yh26yfzy%28v=vs.140%29.aspx">MembershipProvider</a> (Authentication)
  </li>
  <li>
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5k850zwb(v=vs.140).aspx">RoleProvider</a> (Authorization)
  </li>
  <li>
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178581%28v=vs.140%29.aspx">SessionStateProvider</a> (Session)
  </li>
  <li>
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2y3fs9xs(v=vs.140).aspx">ProfileProvider</a> (Profile)
  </li>
</ul>
These providers are configured in a web project profile settings that are used during publication. They use databases and/or 
other resources to fulfill their purpose. The web project settings create genie has a page for selecting the type of 
provider configuration your app uses. 

<br/>
<br/>
<a href="images/security-store-type.png"><img src="images/security-store-type.png" alt="Select security store type."></img></a>
<br/>
<br/>

There are three types:
<ul>
	<li>Active Directory</li>
	<li>Specific IIS Providers</li>
	<li>web.config <span style="font-size: smaller;">(for testing only)</span></li>
</ul>
Users and groups may be defined by your application and may need to be published to a test, staging, or production database for 
use by the MembershipProvider and RoleProvider. This setting is also handled in this configuration and <a href="#PublishUsersAndGroups">explained below</a>.
</p>
<h1>Active Directory</h1>
<p>
The Active Directory option will only be available if you have configured the web application's security settings to use 
Active Directory. For details on configuring your application to use Active Directory for users and group see the 
<a href="https://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/index?search=active%20directory%20integration">
Alpha Anywhere Application Server Active Directory Authentication and Authorization</a> document.
</p>
<p>
The MembershipProvider and RoleProvider configuration is done through the Active Directory Configuration dialog in the 
<a href="https://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/index?search=active%20directory%20integration">Publishing An Application</a> 
section in the document linked above. The session state and profile providers configuration are described in the <a href="#SpecificIISProviders">Specific IIS Providers</a> section below.
</p>
<a name="SpecificIISProviders"></a>
<h1>Specific IIS Providers</h1>

<h2>Provider Definition</h2>
<p>
Provider definitions can have different types of sources based on the selected provider. All providers have at least 4 types of sources:
<ul>
	<li>SqlServer</li>
	<li>MySQL</li>
	<li>Oracle</li>
	<li>Custom</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The SqlServer, MySQL, and Oracle providers are version specific. The versions that are selectable are based on the installed assemblies for the 
provider. SqlServer's version is fixed at 2.0.0.0 and is already installed as part of ASP.NET. MySQL requires a version of the 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MySQL Connector/NET</span> to be installed.
If none is installed Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition can install version 6.7.4. Oracle requires a version of the 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Oracle Data Access Components</span> to be 
installed. The packages for MySQL and Oracle also need to be installed on the IIS server. Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS includes a 
utility for installing MySql Connector/NET 6.7.4: <span class="fixedfont">A5InstallMySqlConnector.exe</span>. This utility is located in the installation folder
which defaults to C:\Program Files (x86)\A5V12 Application Server for IIS.
</p>

<h3>Require Client Certificates</h3>
<p>
A client certificate (also known as PKI authentication) is a way a user can be authenticated instead of using a login page with 
username and password prompts. This advanced feature is available for all "Specific IIS Providers" types.
</p>
<p>
A client certificate is issued by a certificate authority just like a server certificate. Whereas a server certificate validates 
the identity of a server, a client certificate validates the identity of a client e.g. user. When <span style="font-style: italic;">Require Client Certificates</span> 
is enabled, the server will request that the client sends a client certificate with its request. The server will validate the client 
certificate as being issued by the stated certificate authority, is within the issued start and end date, and is not revoked. 
Once the certificate is valid the user is authenticated. The email address for that user is extracted from the certificate and that 
email address is used to authorize the user’s access to pages. The email address can be located either in the subject field or in the 
subject alternative name field.

<div class="note">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: In order for a  server to validate a client certificate, a certificate for the 
certificate authority that issued the client certificate must be installed on the server. This certificate is typically stored 
in the server machine’s Intermediate Certificate Authorities store or the Trusted Root Certificate Authorities store.
</div>

<p>
Developing an application to use client certificates is the same as developing an application to use a login page with username and password
prompts. The only special consideration that needs to be made is that user names must be an email address since an email address will be
extracted from the client certificate to identify the user in the application.
</p>
<p>
An application can add a new user and assign that user to groups using Context.Security() methods in an &quot;Administrator&quot; level 
access pages as is typically done in Alpha Anywhere applications. 
</p>
<h4>Using Require Client Certificates</h4>
<div class="note">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisite</span>: The IIS site must already exist and have an HTTPS binding set before publishing. Refer to the follow Microsoft documents for setting an HTTPS binding:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.iis.net/learn/manage/configuring-security/how-to-set-up-ssl-on-iis">https://www.iis.net/learn/manage/configuring-security/how-to-set-up-ssl-on-iis</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731692(v=ws.10).aspx">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731692(v=ws.10).aspx</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The publish profile defines whether or not a client certificate is required or not. However, a user and group assignments for that user 
must exist in the security tables before that user can be authenticated and authorized in the application. This is the same whether the 
user is authenticated with a username and password or with a client certificate. So the membership and role providers must first be 
defined as would be done when using usernames and passwords.
</p>

<p>
The option to require client certificates is located on the &quot;Advanced Settings...&quot; dialog of the Membership tab of the 
Security Store configuration page of the new publishing profile Genie.
</p>

<p>
<a href="images/require-client-certificates-genie.png"><img src="images/require-client-certificates-genie.png" alt="Require client certificates setting in genie."></img></a>
</p>

<p>
The option is also available in the publish profile property sheet in the membership provider group:
</p>

<p>
<a href="images/require-client-certificates-property-sheet.png"><img src="images/require-client-certificates-property-sheet.png" alt="Require client certificates setting in property sheet."></img></a>
</p>

<p>
Checking this option will configure the IIS site to require client certificates and will also disable anonymous authentication. 
When anonymous authentication is disabled no page for file can be accessed without a client client certificate.
</p>

<p>
After the application has been published with this setting, the browser will prompt the user for a client certificate to be sent 
to the server when a page is requested.
</p>

<h3>Role, Session State, and Profile</h3>
<p>
The Role, Session State, and Profile providers can all use the same provider definition as the Membership provider. They have the 
additional option of: 
<ul>
	<li>SameAsMembershipProvider</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The Session State provider has 2 additional options specific to it:
<ul>
	<li>LocalStateServer</li>
	<li>StateServer</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The Profile provider has one additional option specific to it:
<ul>
	<li>None</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The default source for Role, Session State, and Profile providers is <span class="fixedfont">SameAsMembershipProvider</span>.
</p>

<p>
The following sections define the configuration settings for each source type.
</p>

<h2>SqlServer</h2>
<p>
<a href="images/providerdef.png"><img src="images/providerdef.png" alt="Configure providers."></img></a>
</p>
<p>
The SqlServer type uses the Microsoft SqlServer providers. These providers require a connection string to a database, and, except for the session state provider, a 
security <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.security.sqlmembershipprovider.applicationname(v=vs.100).aspx">application name</a>.
Additionally, you may want to publish users and groups through the membership and role providers. If you need to do this and the provider connection string 
does not have create/update access you can define a connection string to be used at publish time that has create/update access in the Create/Publish 
Connection String prompt. When the web profile is saved an attempt will be made to validate the database is set up for use by the provider. 
If the database cannot be found or parts of the schema are missing you will be prompted to create and/or initialized the database.
</p>
<p>
<div class="note">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: Once the web project profile is saved the provider databases
will be checked if the connection string for create/update is changed. If you want to manually check the provider databases, select the
the profile to be checked in the profile list and then click on the "More..." button underneath the profile list. Select the "Validate Provider Databases"
from the pop-up menu and the databases will be created/initialized if they are not found or there are missing tables.
</p>
<p>
<a href="images/validate-provider-databases.png"><img src="images/validate-provider-databases.png" alt="Validate provider databases."></img></a>
</p>
</div>

<h2>MySQL</h2>
<p>
<a href="images/mysql-provider-def.png"><img src="images/mysql-provider-def.png" alt="Configure MySQL providers."></img></a>
</p>
<p>
The MySQL type is like the Sql Server type, but instead of validating the chosen database when the web profile is saved the MySQL
type has an option for "Automatically generate and update schema" that can be selected. When this option is selected the MySQL
provider will automatically generate or update the database schema when any of the providers are used. This built-in type uses
MySQL .NET Connector 6.7.4.0. There is a utility named <span style="font-style: italic;">A5InstallMySQLConnector.exe</span> that is packaged with 
<span style="font-weight: bold">Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">Alpha Anywhere Application 
Server for IIS</span>. Use it to install the MySQL .NET Connector 6.7.4.0 assemblies on an IIS server and register the assemblies
in the GAC. This utility will also be used by <span style="font-weight: bold">Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition</span> if needed
when publishing users and roles of a web application.
</p>
<div class="note">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: IIS Manager has a feature named ".NET Users" and ".NET Roles" that can be used
to view, edit and add users and roles. In order to use these two features when MySQL is the configured provider the MySQL 
assemblies need to be added to the list of "Trusted Providers" for IIS Manager. This can only  be done by editing the 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\config\administration.config</span> file. You will need to do this from 
an editor "Run as Administrator" or from an editor started from an administrator command prompt. Edit the file and add the 
following 2 lines to the "trustedProviders" section:
<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">
&lt;add type="MySql.Web.Security.MySQLMembershipProvider, MySql.Web, Version=6.7.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=c5687fc88969c44d" /&gt;
<br/><br/>
&lt;add type="MySql.Web.Security.MySQLRoleProvider, MySql.Web, Version=6.7.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=c5687fc88969c44d" /&gt;
</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">This does not need to be done to use MySQL providers in your web application. It is only needed to use the IIS Manager 
".NET Users" and ".NET Roles" features.</span>
</div>

<h2>Oracle</h2>
<p>
<a href="images/oracle-provider-def.png"><img src="images/oracle-provider-def.png" alt="Configure Oracle providers."></img></a>
</p>
<p>
The Oracle type does not generate the required schema. This must be done manually using the utilities installed with the 
Oracle Data Access Components 12c Release 3 (Release 12.1.0.2.1 for ODAC 12c Release 3). The version of the assemblies that 
get installed are 2.121.2.0.
</p>
<div class="note">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: IIS Manager has a feature named ".NET Users" and ".NET Roles" that can be used
to view, edit and add users and roles. In order to use these two features when Oracle is the configured provider the Oracle 
assemblies need to be added to the list of "Trusted Providers" for IIS Manager. This can only  be done by editing the 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\config\administration.config</span> file. You will need to do this from 
an editor "Run as Administrator" or from an editor started from an administrator command prompt. Edit the file and add the 
following 2 lines to the "trustedProviders" section:
<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">
&lt;add type="Oracle.Web.Security.OracleMembershipProvider, Oracle.Web, Version=2.121.2.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89b483f429c47342" /&gt;
<br/><br/>
&lt;add type="Oracle.Web.Security.OracleRoleProvider, Oracle.Web, Version=2.121.2.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89b483f429c47342" /&gt;
</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">This does not need to be done to use Oracle providers in your web application. It is only needed to use the IIS Manager 
".NET Users" and ".NET Roles" features.</span>
</div>

<h2>Custom</h2>
<p>
A custom provider configuration has 1 required setting: The provider class name. This is the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.assemblyqualifiedname%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">assembly qualified name</a> 
of the class that implements the required provider interface. The assembly the class is in must be in the Global Assembly Cache on the server. 
It should also be installed on your development machine so that it can be used to populate its storage if needed as in the case of the membership
or role providers. It is installed on your development machine you will also be able to choose it from the <a href="#SelectProviderClassDialog">Select Provider Class dialog</a>. 
The provider class usually has one or more parameters that can be set to configure how the provider should work. For instance, a membership provider may
limit the number of failed password attempts. This value default to a number, but can be configured through a parameter. The "Edit provider parameters" button
brings up a dialog for adding this parameters. Once a provider class is selected the parameters dialog will be <a href="#ParametersPrefill">pre-filled</a> with the provider's 
public properties. Parameters can be removed, added, and changed as needed. If a provider class is not selected before using the "Edit provider parameters" dialog
the <a href="#ParametersEmpty">list of parameters will be empty</a>. The name of the provider class is displayed under the parameters list.
See the <a href="custom-provider-configuration.html">Custom Provider Configuration</a> document for an example of using Oracle as a customer provider.
</p>
<p>
<a href="images/provider-custom-settings.png"><img src="images/provider-custom-settings.png" alt="Custom provider settings."></img></a>
</p>
<p>
<a name="SelectProviderClassDialog">
The Select Provider Class dialog has prompts for filtering the list of assemblies and an assembly's types. The filtering is applied as you type.
</p>
<p>
<a href="images/provider-class.png"><img src="images/provider-class.png" alt="Select provider class."></img></a>

<p>
<a name="ParametersEmpty" href="images/provider-class-parameters.png"><img src="images/provider-class-parameters.png" alt="Enter parameters required by provider class as name/value pairs."></img></a>
</p>

<h2>SameAsMembershipProvider</h2>
<p>
This source type for role, session State, and profile providers uses the same configuration that is defined for the membership provider.
The same provider connection string, application name, and create/publish connection string will be used. This means all role, session 
state and profile data will be stored in the same database.
</p>

<h2>LocalStateServer</h2>
<p>
IIS is installed with an out of process state server named aspnet_state.exe. This is a Windows service. This service is set
to manual start up by default. The Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS installation program sets this service to automatic start-up
and ensures that it is running. The LocalStateServer setting will have IIS use this service for storing session state.
</p>

<h2>StateServer</h2>
<p>
This is similar to LocalStateServer. An aspnet_state.exe service is running on a remote machine and IIS will connect to that for storing
session state. StateServer is also similar to SqlServer in that session state is stored/accessed on a separate machine which will allow
you to set up a web farm. That is, allow you to have more than one web server process request for a single web site. Each web server 
will point to the same session state data. However, the aspnet_state.exe service only stores session state in memory so if the aspnet_state.exe
service is shut down or crashes the session state data cannot be recovered. The amount of session state that it can handle is also restricted
to the amount of memory on the system. Virtual memory means that running out of memory is unlikely, but performance will degrade as physical 
memory is exceeded. Storing session state under SqlServer persists the session state so that it is recoverable and SqlServer may scale
better than StateServer.
<div class="note">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Warning</span>: Setting up to use a remote aspnet_state.exe is not trivial. If you are not familiar with
managing IIS and the aspnet_state.exe service then SqlServer would be the recommended way to define session state storage in a web farm configuration.
</div>
</p>

<h2>None</h2>
<p>
The profile provider allows you to store persistent data for a logged in user. This is different from the Session State which is only 
persistent for the session lifetime. If your web application does not need user profile data or already manages user profile data in 
a different way, use None for the Profile provider source.
</p>

<a name="webConfigType"></a>
<h1>web.config <span style="font-size: smaller;">(for testing only)</span></h1>
<p>
The web.config option is only appropriate for testing or proof-of-concepts where only a demonstration of users and groups is needed.
The users and groups data is stored in the web application's web.config file which is only moderately secure, does not scale well, and 
is not easy to maintain. This option only has a pre-set configuration.
</p>

<a name="PublishUsersAndGroups"></a>
<h1>Publish Security Data</h1>
<p>
Security data (users and groups) for your application can be published to the security store that your membership and role 
providers use when your security store type is Specific IIS Providers. Alpha Anywhere has six different modes for publishing 
security data:
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preserve</span> - Publish only if no users and roles are found in the destination. Both the user store and the role 
	store must be empty for anything to get published. For example, if there is 1 user and no roles nothing (neither user nor roles) will get published
	because that one user already exists.</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ignore</span> - Do not publish users or roles.</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merge</span> - Add new users and roles. Any users and roles that don't exist in the store will be added. Existing
	users and roles remain unchanged.</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Replace</span> - Replace all users and roles. Any existing users and roles are removed user and role store 
	and then the users and roles defined in the web project are added to the users and roles store.</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merge Roles</span> - Add new roles. Any new roles defined in the web project are added to the role store.</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Replace Roles</span> - Replace all roles. All roles are delete from the role store and then the roles defined
	in the web project are added to the roles store. Note: If a role of the same name as a role that was deleted will be re-associated with any users 
	that were members of the original role.</li>
</ul>
This option is set at the bottom of the genie dialog and it defaults <span style="font-weight: bold;">Preserve</span>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="images/publish-security.png"><img src="images/publish-security.png" alt="Select how to publish security data."></img></a>
</p>
<p>
The value you select is the default value used at publish time in the <a href="#PublishWebProject">Publish Web Project dialog</a> and the <a href="#PublishSecurityFiles">Publish Security Files dialog</a> 
located in the <a href="#WebSecurity">Web Security dialog</a>. 
</p>
<p><a name="PublishWebProject" href="images/publish-web-project.png"><img src="images/publish-web-project.png" alt="Publish Web Project dialog."></img></a></p>
<p><a name="WebSecurity" href="images/web-security.png"><img src="images/web-security.png" alt="Web security dialog."></img></a></p>
<p><a name="PublishSecurityFiles" href="images/publish-security-files.png"><img src="images/publish-security-files.png" alt="Publish security files dialog."></img></a></p>

<a name="ModifyProviderConfig"></a>
<h1>Modify Provider Configuration</h1>
<p>
Once a profile is saved, the provider configuration can be modified in the Miscellaneous section of the property grid for that profile.
</p>
<p>
<a href="images/modify-provider-configuration.png"><img src="images/modify-provider-configuration.png" alt="Modify provider configuration."></img></a>
</p>

<a name="ProviderConfigExample"></a>
<h1>Provider Configuration Example</h1>
<p>
This example uses a remote SqlServer Express database for membership, role, and session state. This example does not
use a profile provider. A new database for membership, roles, and session state will be created and initialized. The 
SqlServer Express server instance already has a login defined for "AspNetDb_Test_User". This login will be added as a
user in the new database, it will be given access to the database, and will be used in the provider connection string.
I will use my domain account, which has sysadmin access, and integrated authentication for the create/publish 
connection string.
</p>

<p>
If you already have a web project profile for publishing the App Server Demo web application to an IIS server, you can use the
"Duplicate Profile" button and then make changes to the new copy of the profile following <a href="#SqlServerExpressInstanceDuplicateProfile">these steps below</a>.
If you haven't created a web project profile for publishing the App Server Demo web application to an IIS server follow these instructions
for <a href="#SqlServerExpressInstance">creating a new profile</a>.
</p>

<a name="SqlServerExpressInstanceDuplicateProfile">
<h4>Using a remote SqlServer Express instance when editing a duplicated profile</h4>
<p>
If you have already created a Web Project Profile by following the <a href="https://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/index?search=iis%20overview">Getting Started Guide</a>
instructions, you can duplicate this profile and then change the provider configuration for the duplicate profile.
</p>
<p>
<a href="images/web-profile-grid.png"><img src="images/web-profile-grid.png" alt="Web profile grid with Duplicate button highlighted."></img></a>
</p>
<p>
After you have duplicated the profile scroll down to the bottom of the property grid to get to the Security Store Type combobox. It will be
set to "web.config (for testing only)" since that was the only type available in earlier versions.
</p>

<h4>Using a remote SqlServer Express instance when creating a new profile</h4>
<p>
This example will revise the steps in the Application Server Demo publish example in the 
<a href="https://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/index?search=iis%20overview">Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS Getting Started Guide</a>.
That example uses the "web.config <span style="font-size: smaller;">(for testing only)</span>" option. "web.config" was the only option before this provider configuration UI was implemented.
Follow all the steps in the Getting Started Guide until you get to the Security Store Configuration genie page. 
Once you have completed the security store configuration steps, continue with the Getting Started Guide finishing the steps for 
publishing Application Server Demo web application.

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Click on the smart button to bring up the Create SQL Connection String dialog.</p>
		<p><a href="images/connection-string-smart-button.png"><img src="images/connection-string-smart-button.png" alt="Connection string smart button."></img></a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Enter your server name, "AspNetDb_Test_User" in the user prompt and then the password for that user. (Or use an existing SqlServer user.)</p>
		<p><a href="images/connection-string-dialog.png"><img src="images/connection-string-dialog.png" alt="Connection string dialog."></img></a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>This example creates a new database. Since this user does not have access to create a database you cannot create the database 
	from this dialog. If you want to test the connection make sure that the database name is blank so that the Test Connection won't attempt
	to connect to a database that doesn't exist yet. Once you have tested the connection enter "AspNetDb_Test" into the Database prompt.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Click OK to create the connection string.</p></li>
	<li><p>Back on the Genie page, leave the default value of "/" in the Security application name prompt.</p></li>
	<li>
		<p>Click on the "Advanced Settings..." button</p>
		<p><a href="images/create-publish-connection-string-section.png"><img src="images/create-publish-connection-string-section.png" alt="Membership provider advanced settings."></img></a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Click on the "Use a different connection string for publishing security data." This will copy the provider connection
	string into the Create/Publish connection string prompt. Click on the smart button to bring up the Create SQL Connection String dialog.</p>
		<p><a href="images/advanced-settings.png"><img src="images/advanced-settings.png" alt="Create/publish connection string section."></img></a></p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Click on the Use Windows Authentication check-box and then OK to save the connection string. If you are not using Windows authentication
	enter the credentials for a user with permission to create databases such as the "sa" user.</p>
		<p><a href="images/connection-string-dialog-integrated.png"><img src="images/connection-string-dialog-integrated.png" alt="Connection string dialog with Use Windows Authentication checked."></img></a></p>
	</li>	
	<li>
		<p>When the connection string is saved the database schema will be validated. Since the database doesn't exist yet you will
	be prompted to create and initialize it.</p>
		<p><a href="images/create-and-initialize-prompt.png"><img src="images/create-and-initialize-prompt.png" alt="Prompt for create and initialize provider database."></img></a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>For the Role and Session State tabs keep the source set to "SameAsMembershipProvider". For the Profile tab, change the source to None.</p>
		<p><a href="images/profile-none.png"><img src="images/profile-none.png" alt="Set profile provider source to None."></img></a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Since the role provider and session state provider use the "SameAsMembershipProvider" source, the database schema for the role and session state provider
		won't be validated until the profile is saved. You will get the following 2 prompts:</p>
		<p><a href="images/prompts-for-missing-schema.png"><img src="images/prompts-for-missing-schema.png" alt="Prompts for missing schema."></img></a></p>

		<p>Now you can continue with the rest of the instructions in the
		<a href="https://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/index?search=iis%20overview">Getting Started Guide</a>
		for publishing the App Server Demo web application to an IIS server.</p>

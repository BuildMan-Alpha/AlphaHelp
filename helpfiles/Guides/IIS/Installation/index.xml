                        <p>For a production environment the minimum IIS server version is 7.5 and Windows Server 2008 R2. The steps and images below are from IIS 8.0 and Windows Server 2012 Standard.</p>
                        <p>For a development environment Windows 7 (32-bit or 64-bit) is the minimum desktop version.</p>

                        <p>These directions assume familiarity with IIS and Windows Server 2012. See [Detailed steps to install IIS on Windows Server 2012] in the appendix for more detailed set of instructions if you are not familiar with IIS and Windows Server 2012. For a Windows 7 development machine see the [Detailed Steps to Install IIS on Windows 7] in the appendix.</p>

                                <p>Add the Web Server (IIS) role.</p>
                                <p>Include the Management Tools feature and select the Management Service. This service is required for publishing. The IIS Management Console is not required unless you want to manage IIS locally.</p>

                                Include ASP.NET 4.5 role service under Application Development. If you are using IIS 7.5 on Windows Server 2008 R2 the option is labelled ASP.NET with no version specified. However, you must have .NET 4.5 installed on Windows Server 2008 R2.</description>

                                Include the Application Initialization role service under Application Development for a better user experience. For more details or if you are running IIS 7.5 see [Application Initialization] in the appendix.

                                While not required it is a good idea to include the Tracing feature under Health and Diagnostics to aid debugging when web requests fail.

                                Consider enabling dynamic compression too. This will allow responses from dynamic pages such as an .a5w page to be compressed. For more details see the IIS documentation [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.webserver/httpcompression/] and this Microsoft blog post [https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/friis/2017/09/05/iis-dynamic-compression-and-new-dynamic-compression-features-in-iis-10/].

                        <p>See details about [the components that are installed] in the appendix. Of note, Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS uses the ASP.NET State Service for session state. This service is started if it isn't running already and it is set to startup automatically by the installer.</p>

                    <description>
                        <p>To install the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS silently (or unattended) you will need to specify the location of a file that contains your license key. You may also specify a different install location. Both of these settings are done using environment variables.</p>
                        <p>To specify an install location that is different than the default "C:\Program Files (x86)\A5V12 Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS" set an environment variable named *[A5_MAINDIR]*.</p>
                    </description>
                    <note>For silent installs, you must also set an environment variable called *[SILENT]* to *[YES]*.</note>

                    <description>
                        <p>To have the installer also set the license key set an environment variable named *[A5_LICENSE_PATH]* to the path of an AlphaAnywhere.lic file.</p>
                        <p>Then install silently by using the /s parameter</p>

                        <p>Once the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS is installed it will run in unlicensed mode. 5 users can be active 						on an unlicensed mode server allowing development and testing to be done without needing a license. If more users are
						needed or the server is running in production a license is required.

                        <p>To set the license, open IIS Manager, select the server node, and open the License Information feature.</p>

                        <p>Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition publishes a web application directly to an IIS server. To publish directly to an IIS Server from Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition you are required to install two Microsoft components on the IIS Server.</p>
                        <p>The server requires Microsoft Web Deploy 3.5 or later, adding the Management Service feature and enabling remote connections in IIS, and opening up some inbound ports with firewall rules on the server you want to publish to.</p>
                        <p>The Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition machine requires the IIS Management Console and Microsoft Web Deploy 3.5 or later. Installing the IIS Management Console will install the required assembly Microsoft.Web.Administration.dll that is not redistributable and is needed for direct publishing. The IIS Management Console install can be found under the Control Panel's "Programs and Features" section in the "Turn Windows features on or off" link on client operating systems (i.e. Windows 7 and Windows 8). Microsoft Web Deploy 3.5 or later will install the Microsoft.Web.Deployment assemblies.</p>
                    </description>
                    <note>
                        In order to publish using integrated Windows authentication you must run Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition as administrator. Running it under a local administrator account is not enough. You must either right-click on the program icon and choose "Run as administrator" or go into the program icon's properties and set it to be Run as administrator.

                        <p>To allow direct publishing from Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition to IIS you will need to make some configuration changes on the IIS server machine. Select the tab below for the type of operating system that IIS is installed on: Server OS for Windows Server 2008R2, 2012, or 2012R2; or Client OS for Windows 7, 8, or 8.1.</p>

                                        Check Enable remote connections in IIS Manager Management Service at the server level. This will open up port 8172 in the server's firewall. This is listed as Web Management Service (HTTP Traffic-In) in the Windows firewall inbound rules.

                                        Disabling remote connections (unchecking Enable remote connections) does not disable the inbound firewall rule for port 8172 Web Management Service (HTTP Traffic-In). This will have to be done manually to close that port.

                                        <p>To publish from Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition to an IIS server, the user you are publishing under needs to have local administrator access on the IIS server machine. The user or group a user is in also needs to be given privilege to run some utilities during publish. This privilege is the "Replace a process level token" privilege in the Local Security Policy. This is required so that a site and application pool can be created at publish time if needed. This privilege is also required so that server configuration can be validated to ensure that the web application will run as expected. Select the users and/or groups that are allowed to publish to IIS from Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition.</p>

In order to select users or groups on the remote server port 445 must be opened in the firewall. This port is prone to probing attacks andis closed by default. The added button "Enable Remote Active Directory Access" will open port 445 for your local IP address only on the remote server so that the remote server will allow the user and group lookup. When you are done adding users or group, click on the button again(it will be labelled "Disable Remote Active Directory Access") to close the firewall port.

                                Directory Browsing under Common HTTP Features. Usually allowing directory browser is considered a security risk because it can reveal information about your application that may provide an attacker with clues on how to attempt to breach your security. It is recommended to turn this off.

                                Application Initialization under Application Development. Application Initialization allows IIS to pre-load a web application before the first user visits the application preventing the user from experiencing load delays. Application Initialization also allow IIS to continue to use a running application pool while it pre-loads another instance of an application pool for an application pool recycle. This again prevents any load delays to a user using the application. While this feature isn't required it will give end users a better experience using your web applications. If you are using IIS 7.5 you need to complete installation of IIS, follow the steps [Install Application Initialization in IIS 7.5] in the appendix to get this feature and then return to IIS role services in the Add Roles and Feature Wizard to add this feature.

It should launch after installation, but if it does not or you already have it installed click on the "Get New Web Platform Components" link in IIS Manager when the server node is selected in the Connections pane on the left.</p>

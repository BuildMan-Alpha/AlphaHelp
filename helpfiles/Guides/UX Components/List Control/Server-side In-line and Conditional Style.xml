      <description> Previously, if you defined a server-side in-line or conditional style for a field in a List control, a span was inserted into the data on the server to format the data. While this gave the required visual appearance, it meant that if you read the value from the control, the value that you read included the HTML markup. 
This has now been changed. The server-side style is computed on the server and is now included in a separate (hidden) field in the List data. The style is then applied on the client-side. The net result of this change is that when you read data from a field that has a server-side style, the data no longer includes any HTML markup.

      <description>You can drag on the scroller in much the same way that you drag on the 'thumb' portion of a scrollbar in a desktop application. When you stop dragging on the scroller, the corresponding row in the List is brought into view.

      <description>While you are dragging on the scroller, a message is displayed showing what record would be shown if you were to stop dragging. The contents of the message is completely customizable. It is actually a standard HTML List template and it supports all of the template features for List controls. The message can display fields from the data in the List.
The List scroller is particularly useful for virtualized Lists because a virtualized List can contain a very large number of rows. Using the scroller you can quickly navigate to any row in the List without having to drag scroll one screen at a time.
However, List scrollers are not limited to virtualized Lists. They can also be used with non-virtualized Lists.
(See below for information on Virtualized Lists).

      <description>To turn on the List scroller, check the 'Has scroller' property on the List Properties pane in the List builder.
You can use placeholders for any field in the List in the template.

      <note>Previously, the 'scroller' feature was only supported for Lists if the UX style was set to iOS7, AndroidDark or AndroidLight. Now, the scroller is supported for all styles.</note>

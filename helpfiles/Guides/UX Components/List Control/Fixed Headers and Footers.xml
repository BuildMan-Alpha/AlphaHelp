     <description>List controls have always supported 'data' headers and footers. Data headers appear before the first row of data (below the List titles) and after the last row of data. When the List is scrolled, the data header and footer can scroll out of view. 
Fixed headers and footers, on the other hand, appear above and below the List and are always visible regardless of how the List has been scrolled.
To turn on fixed headers and footers, check the appropriate property in the List Properties pane in the List builder.

     <note>To insert controls in the header or footer (e.g. input controls, buttons, etc), add the control to the UX and wrap then in an 'Injectible' container. The inject the contents into the header or footer as shown in the image below. When you open the header or footer editor you will see a hyperlink that generates the required code.</note>

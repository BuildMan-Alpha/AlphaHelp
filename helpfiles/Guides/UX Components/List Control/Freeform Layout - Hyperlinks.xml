  <description>When you create a free-form List layout you can use any HTML that you want to lay out each row in the List. Your HTML template will include placeholders for the various fields in the List.

For example:
</description>
  
  <sections>
    
    <section>
    
   <example><![CDATA[Name: {name}
Address: {address}]]></example>
    </section>
       <section>
      <description>Because the template is HTML, you might expect to be able to add hyperlinks. For example:
</description>
   <example><![CDATA[Name: {name}
Address: {address}
Open Page]]></example>
    </section>
       <section>
      <description>This will not work because the List is configured to handle all events. However, you can make this pattern work by adding markup to your html to stop event propagation. For example:
</description>
   <example><![CDATA[Open Page
]]></example>
    </section>
       <section>
      <description>With the addition of event handlers for the onclick and ontouchstart events which stop event propagation, the hyperlink will work as expected.

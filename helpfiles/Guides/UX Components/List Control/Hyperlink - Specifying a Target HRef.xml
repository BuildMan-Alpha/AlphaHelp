  <topic>UX Component - List Control - Hyperlink - Specifying a Target HRef</topic>
  <description>When you add a hyperlink control to a List, you can define standard HTML hyperlinks with an 'href' attribute that specifies the hyperlink target, as an alternative to using Javascript code.</description>

     <description>To specify a hyperlink target, set the 'Action type' to 'Href' and then specify the 'Hyperlink address'. You can use a placeholder for the address. For example if your List has a field called 'address', you can specify the 'Hyperlink address' as {address}. 
The hyperlink address must include the protocol if the target is not a page in the application webroot. For example, to display bing.com, you would need to set the target to 'http://www.bing.com', but to display a page called 'page1.a5w' in the current webroot, you would just need to set the target to 'page1.a5w'.

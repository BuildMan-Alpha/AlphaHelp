  <topic>List Preview - Modeless</topic>
  
  <description>The List Builder has a 'Preview' button to do a quick preview of the List control while you are in the List builder. The Preview window is now modeless - which means you can keep it open while you are working in the List builder (and perhaps move it to a second screen if your computer has two monitors). This makes it very convenient to preview the List after every change you make.</description>

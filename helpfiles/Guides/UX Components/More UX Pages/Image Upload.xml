        <description>The Action Javascript builder has an option in the Thumbnail Definition Builder that allows you to specify if the thumbnail file that is created should overwrite an existing file, or be renamed, so as not to conflict with existing files.

        <title>File Rename</title>
        <description>When you upload images or files and store the uploaded images or files in a filename on a server, there is an option to rename the file if there is an existing file with the same name on the server. Here is how the algorithm that computes the filename in the case of a conflict works. If a filed called "c:\myimages\image1.jpg" exists and you want to create a new file called 'image1.jpg', the new file will be called "c:\myimages\myimage1_1.jpg".

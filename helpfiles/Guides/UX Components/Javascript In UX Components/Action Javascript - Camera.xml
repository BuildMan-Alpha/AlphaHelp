   <description>The 'Image Capture - Camera/Photo Library' action allows you to specify some Javascript code to execute once the image has been acquired. Your Javascript code can reference:

<cases>
    <case>
        <description>e.data - the base64 encoded image data </description>
    </case>
     <case>
        <description>e.fileSystemURL - (PhoneGap only) the native file system URL for the image.

    </case>

       <note>Contrast this action with the 'Image Capture for List-Detail View - Camera/Photo Library' which also allows you to capture an image using the camera. This action however, is specifically for an Image control in a List View with a Detail View. The  'Image Capture - Camera/Photo Library' action simply returns the image data (base 64 encoded) and the native file URL (in the case where PhoneGap is being used). It is up to the developer to decide what to do with the base64 encoded data or file URL.</note>

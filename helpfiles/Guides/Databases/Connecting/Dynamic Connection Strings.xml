    <topic>Creating Dynamic Connection Strings</topic>
    <description>A dynamic connection string is a connection string that is resolved at the time the database connection is opened, rather than at the time the connection string is defined.</description>
    <discussion>Dynamic connection strings can be created in Alpha Anywhere in one of two ways: by defining a connection string using the *[xb:DynamicConnection_]* prefix or using the *[xb:::EVAL::]* prefix, which allows you to define an Xbasic function or expression that is used to dynamically calculate the connection string.</discussion>

            <title>Using the DynamicConnection_ Prefix to Define Dynamic Connection Strings</title>
            <description>Dynamic connection strings can be defined using a prefix. A connection string named "*[xb:<![CDATA[DynamicConnection_<name>]]>]*", where <![CDATA[<name>]]> is a user-defined string identifying the connection string, will be resolved dynamically at runtime. For example:</description>
            <example><![CDATA[DynamicConnection_MyCustomApplication]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p>In the dynamic connection string above, the <![CDATA[<name>]]> is "MyCustomApplication".</p>
                <p>The actual value of the dynamic connection string is resolved by referring to a session variable called *[xb:<![CDATA[session.__protected__<name>]]>]*. For the dynamic connection string defined above, the session variable would be as follows:</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[session.__protected__MyCustomApplication]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p>The value of *[xb:<![CDATA[session.__protected__<name>]]>]* defines the actual connection string to be used.</p>
                <p>The value of this session variable is typically set when the user logs into the application. For example, it could be set to a named connection such as:</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[::Name::User1Connection]]></example>

            <title>Using Xbasic Expressions to Create Dynamic Connection Strings</title>
            <description>
                <p>Dynamic connection strings can also be created using the *[xb:::EVAL::]* prefix. The *[xb:::EVAL::]* prefix is used in the named connection string, similar to how the *[xb:::Name::]* prefix is used for named connections.</p>
                <p>Prefixing a connection string with *[xb:::EVAL::]* causes the connection string to be evaluated as an Xbasic expression.</p>
                <p>For example, consider the following connection string:</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[::EVAL::MyFunctionThatReturnsAConnString()]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p>When an AlphaDAO connection is opened using the above string, the *[xb:MyFunctionThatReturnsAConnString()]* is evaluated and the return value (which would typically be a named connection string with the *[xb:::Name::]* prefix) is used as the connection string.</p>
                <p>In this next example, the dynamic connection string uses an in-line Xbasic expression:</p>
            </description>
            <example><![CDATA[::EVAL::if(User = "Fred","::name::Fred","::name::EverybodyElse")]]></example>

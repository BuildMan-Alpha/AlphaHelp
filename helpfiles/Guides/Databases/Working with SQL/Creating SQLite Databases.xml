        <p>The *[ui:Create SQLite Database]* option on the Tools menu (when the Web Projects Control Panel has focus) allows you to create an SQL database and populate the database with data. After the SQLite database has been created, it can optionally be uploaded to Amazon S3. This makes it easy for mobile applications to download the database and store it on a device.</p>
        <p>To create a SQLite database, go to *[ui:Tools]*, *[ui:More...]*, *[ui:Create SQLite Database]* on the Web Projects Control Panel.</p>

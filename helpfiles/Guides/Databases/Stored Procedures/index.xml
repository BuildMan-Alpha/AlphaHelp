    <description>How to use Native Stored Procedures in Alpha Anywhere.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>Stored Procedures are compiled SQL code stored in the database. Calling stored procedures as opposed to sending over query strings improves the performance of an application. Not only is there less network traffic since only short commands are sent instead of long query stings, but the execution of the actual code itself also improves. The reason is because a stored procedure is already compiled ahead of time. Stored procedures are also cached when they are run improving performance of subsequent calls.</p>
        <p>Other than improving performance, stored procedures are also helpful because they provide another layer of abstraction for your application. For instance, you can change a query in a stored procedure and get different results without having to republish your app. Using stored procedures also makes your objects cleaner, and some data base management systems such as SQL Server provide tools that make it easy to back up your stored procedures.</p>
        <p>Stored procedures can be utilized in Xbasic scripts or as the data source for reports or components.</p>

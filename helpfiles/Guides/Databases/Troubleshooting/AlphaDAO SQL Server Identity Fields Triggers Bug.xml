	<topic>SQL Server Triggers: Last Inserted Identity is for Child Record not Parent (Alpha Five V10 and older)</topic>
	<description>
		<p>In Alpha Five Version 10 and prior, an issue exists where the identity returned for the last inserted record is for a child table and not the master table. This issue only applies to SQL Server where an Insert Trigger has been defined. This issue is fixed in Alpha Anywhere.</p>

		<p>There is a bug in SQL Server when you get the value of the last inserted identity column value under the following situation. Say you have a table (called say, 'MasterTable'). 'MasterTable' has an identity column. 'MasterTable' also has an Insert Trigger which inserts a new record into a table (called say, 'ChildTable'). 'ChildTable' also has an identity column. When you insert a record into 'MasterTable', the following AlphaDAO command can be used to get the value of the last inserted identity column:</p>
		<p>
			<example code="xb"><![CDATA[<SQL::Connection Object>.CallResult.LastInsertedIdentity]]></example>
		</p>
		<p>The SQL Server bug is that this command will return the value of the identity value inserted into 'ChildTable' and not 'MasterTable', as you would expect.</p>
		<p>Microsoft does not have a fix for this. The problem affects Grid components because retrieving the value of the last inserted identity field is crucial to many aspects of the Grid performance.</p>
		<p>The suggested work around is to not use identity columns in tables that are manipulated by triggers. Instead you could use GUIDs for the primary keys of these tables.</p>

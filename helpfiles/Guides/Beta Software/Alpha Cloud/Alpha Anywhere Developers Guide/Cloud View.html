<h3><a id="CloudViewDialog">The Cloud View Dialog</a></h3><br/>
<p>The Cloud View dialog provides access to status, activity and logs for applications you have deployed on Alpha Cloud.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select the application and the deployment of that application you want to look at.</li>
	<li>The Currently Active Servers tab page will show all servers running your deployed application along with their status.</li>
	<li>Select a date range to analyze and click the Update Analysis button to retrieve activity and lists of logs for that date range.</li>
	<li>When the analysis is complete, the Server Load, Application Requests, IIS Logs and Alpha Anywhere Logs tab pages will be populated.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your application has been deployed, you can click on the web link to open your application in a browser.</p>

<h3><a id="CloudViewDeploymentStatus">The Deployment Status Tab Page</a></h3><br/>
<p>Once you schedule your application for deployment, by publishing and deploying or using the Manage Deployments Dialog, 
and the scheduled deployment becomes active, 
a series of tasks will be triggered that result in your application being installed or updated on a running web site.
<p>

<h4>Server Status</h4>
<p>Each windows server that is running your application deployment is displayed on the Server Status tab page.  The columns displayed are:</p></br>
	<dl>
		<dt><span>Instance</span></dt><dd><span>A unique identifier assigned by the cloud infrastructure for the server.</span></dd>
		<dt><span>Host</span></dt><dd><span>The windows host name assigned to the server. This can be used to find IIS and Alpha Anywhere logs for a specific server.</span></dd>
		<dt><span>Start Time</span></dt><dd><span>The date and time the Alpha Anywhere software started running on the server. This is the time the server became available to service requests.</span></dd>
		<dt><span>Last Heartbeat</span></dt><dd><span>The last date and time the Alpha Anywhere software running on the server reported that it was running.</span></dd>
		<dt><span>State</span></dt><dd><span>The cloud infrastructure reported state of the server instance.  An instances may be initializing, in service, terminating or terminated.  After a period of time, terminated servers are removed from the list.</span></dd>
		<dt><span>Health</span></dt><dd><span>The cloud infrastructure reported health of the server, based on it's ability to respond on the network. Running servers will generally be reported as "Healthy" unless there is a problem.</span></dd>

<h4>Deployment Events</h4>
<p>As each deployment task starts and ends, the occurrence is logged.  The Deployment Events tab page shows the history of those tasks for your scheduled deployment.</p>

<br/>
<p><strong>Oops! Something went wrong.  What do I do?</strong></p>
<p> Occasionally an error may occur during deployment.  
If an error occurs, the list of events will include error messages in the description column.
If the message makes sense and appears to be temporary, you may want to republish (or redeploy) your application.
If the error appears to be more permanent, click <strong>Copy Events to Clipboard</strong> and paste the clipboard contents into an e-mail addressed to AlphaCloudBugs@AlphaSoftware.com.

<h3><a id="CloudViewIISLogs">The IIS Logs Tab Page</a></h3><br/>
<p>IIS creates log files for your application to record requests for resources.  These can include web pages, images, reports, and AJAX callbacks.</p>
<p>Alpha Cloud configures the Advanced Logging Module from Microsoft to create one log for each deployed application each hour that your application is deployed on that server.  Alpha Cloud automatically copies the logs from the running server to cloud storage.  The logs can be retrieved and reviewed at a later time even if the server itself is terminated.</p>
<p>The IIS Logs tab page lists the logs created during the time you specified as your analysis time frame and presents them in a tree view display by host name and then date and time and then displays them again by date and time and then by host name.  If you open the tree view to the lowest level in the tree and double click on that entry, the log is retrieved and displayed in the text box on the right-hand pane of the dialog.</p>

<h3><a id="CloudViewAlphaAnywhereLogs">The Alpha Anywhere Logs Tab Page</a></h3><br/>
<p>When Alpha Anywhere for IIS runs on the cloud, all error logging and tracing is consolidated into a single file.  There is one file for each deployed application and server and each hour that your application is deployed.</p>
<p>Alpha Cloud automatically copies the logs from the running server to cloud storage.  The logs can be retrieved and reviewed at a later time, even if the server itself is terminated.</p></br>
<p>The Alpha Anywhere Logs tab page lists the logs created during the time you specified as your analysis time frame and presents them in a tree view display by host name and then date and time and then displays them again by date and time and then by host name.</p>
<p>If you open the tree view to the lowest level in the tree and double click on that entry, the log is retrieved and displayed on the right hand- pane of the dialog.</p>
<p>The display pane for Alpha Anywhere logs has two tabs within it.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The <a href="#CloudViewAlphaAnywhereLogsContent">Content</a> tab displays the data from the log by column, making it easier to scan.</li>
	<li>The <a href="#CloudViewAlphaAnywhereLogsText">Text</a> tab displays the raw contents of the log (a CSV formatted file) making individual entries easier to read.</li>
	</ul>

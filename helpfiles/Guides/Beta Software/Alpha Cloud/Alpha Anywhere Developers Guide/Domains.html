<h3><a id="UnderstandingDomainNames">Understanding Domain Names</a></h3><br/>

<p>Internet resources, such as web sites, are located using a numeric identifier called an IP address.
In order to make it easier to find and remember those addresses and make it possible to change addresses easily, a naming registry is used called the <strong>Domain Name System</strong>.
A <strong>domain name</strong> is a string of labels separated by dots in a very specific format (discussed below).  
A <strong>host name</strong> is a domain name that has one or more IP addresses associated with it.
</p>

<p>The domain name system is organized hierarchically.  
There are a number of variations in how that hierarchy is layed out.
The most common cases are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>At the very top is the <strong>root domain</strong>.</li>
	<li>Directly beneath the root domain are <strong>top-level domains</strong> such as "com", "net", "org", "gov", "mil", and "edu" (Note that each country can have its own hierarchy, so that adds a little complexity that we won't discuss here.)</li>
	<li>Companies, organizations and even individuals register a <strong>subdomain name</strong> (often referred to as a <strong>domain</strong>) at the next level (under a top-level domain).  
		Some examples of registered domains that are well known include amazon.com, google.com, and of course alphasoftware.com.</li>
	<li>Under a domain can be more <strong>nesting of subdomains</strong> (for example organizations within a company).  
		This hierarchy can contain up to 127 levels with each part being up to 63 characters (octets) long.
		The entire domain name cannot exceed 253 characters of text.</li>
	<li>The final component of the domain name is a <strong>specific server or a service name</strong>.  
		For example "www" and "ftp" can be used to designate a web server or an FTP server.
		You can also specify the name of a machine as the final component of the hierarchy.</li>
</ul><br/>

<p>The full domain name used to look up the internet address of a server or service is formatted by combining all of the parts and separating each of them with a dot.
The domain name is formatted from the bottom of the hierarchy to the top.  
This means that the service or machine name is on the left followed by its parent subdomain and so on up to the top-level domain name.
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
	<li>www.amazon.com</li>
	<li>ftp.mycompany.com</li>
	<li>www.accounting.mycompany.com</li>
	<li>mymachine.mycompany.com</li>
</ul><br/>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The names are usually represented in lower case, although the domain name system is case-insensitive.</p>


<h3><a id="AutomaticallyGeneratedDNS">Domain Names Generated By Alpha Cloud</a></h3><br/>
<p>Alpha Cloud automatically generates a domain name entry suitable for testing your deployed web site from the internet.  
To keep the name fairly readable and predictable, Alpha Cloud generates the name as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Subscription Keys</strong> - For each subscription, a readable key is generated from the customer name and the subscription name that is guaranteed to be unique across Alpha Cloud.
		For example, if your company name is "MyCompany" and you have only one subscription, your subscription key might be "mycompany".
		Once the subscription key is generated, it is kept constant.
		</li>
	<li><strong>Web Site Keys</strong> - For each web site within a subscription, a readable key is generated from the web site name that is guaranteed to be unique within the subscription.
		For example if your web site name is "Production", your web site key might be "production".
		Again, once the site key is generated, it is kept the same for a web site.
		</li>
	<li><strong>Domain Names</strong> - For each web site you deploy, a domain name is generated using the subscription key, the web site key and the Alpha Cloud subdomain in the format below:<br/><br/>
		<p class="tab">&lt;subscription key&gt;-&lt;web site key&gt;.&lt;Alpha Cloud subdomain&gt;</p>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<p class="tab">mycompany-production.cloud.alphasoftware.com</p>
		</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The names used in this example are illustrative only.  
	From within Alpha Anywhere you can find the current URL for any web site or deployment on the dialogs where you manage them.
</p>
		

<h3><a id="CustomDNSNames">Creating Your Own Custom Domain Name</a></h3><br/>


<p>
Although it can be handy for small in-house applications and for testing, the name generated by Alpha Cloud is long and difficult to type.
The automatically generated name is also not part of your domain.
</p>
<p>
For a production site, you will want to register a domain, set up a domain name for your deployed web site and purchase a TLS (also called SSL) certificate 
(discussed in <a href="Certificates.html">Alpha Cloud Certificates</a>).
</p>

<h4><a id="RegisteringDomains">Registering Your Own Domain</a></h4>

<p>To register a domain, you will need to work with a registrar.  There are many registrars available.  
While we cannot recommend any specific registrar, some of the more commonly used include GoDaddy, Network Solutions, Register.com, Domain.com, and Yahoo.
Each registrar will have their own signup process so you will want to start with their web site and proceed from there.
</p>

<h4><a id="CreatingDNSNames">Creating Your Own Custom Domain Name</a></h3><br/>

<p>Once you have registered your domain, you will need to create a domain name for your site (the name that you want your users to enter as part of the URL for your web site).
The most common prefix for a web site is, of course, "www".  
If this interferes with another site on your domain, you can create an alternative host name or create a new domain specific to your deployed web site.
</p>

<p>You will need to work with your registrar to create a link between your domain name and the actual site running on Alpha Cloud.
This is done by creating a record in the domain registry that connects the name you want your customers to use and the domain name Alpha Cloud generates for you.
</p>
<p>Mapping your customer domain name to your Alpha Cloud web site domain name will require that your registrar create a record in their system.  
Domain name registrars generally support several different record types for domain name management and mapping.
The more common mapping records are:
</p>
<dl>
	<dt><strong>A Records</strong></dt>
		<dd>The A record maps a domain name directly to an IP version 4  address (IPv4).
			Using an A record saves a step in the translation from a domain name to an IP address, but at the cost of flexibility.
			Alpha Cloud does not guarantee that an IP address will be constant over time, so this option is not currently available.
			</dd><br/>
	<dt><strong>AAAA Records</strong></dt>
		<dd>The AAAA record maps a domain name directly to an IP version 6 address (IPv6).
			Using an AAAA record saves a step in the translation from a domain name to an IP address, but at the cost of flexibility.
			Alpha Cloud does not guarantee that an IP address will be constant over time, so this option is not currently available.
			</dd><br/>
	<dt><strong>CNAME Records</strong></dt>
		<dd>The CNAME record maps a domain name to another domain name rather than an IP address.  
			In our example your domain name might be "www.mycompany.com".
			You would want to map "www.mycompany.com" to "mycompany-production.cloud.alphasoftware.com".
		</dd>
</dl><br/>
<p><strong>Important!</strong></p>
<p class="tab">You will need to use a <strong>CNAME </strong> record to map your custom domain name to Alpha Cloud's generated domain name.</p>			

<p>
Your registrar will need to know the full domain name that your customers will use in URLs for your web site and the domain name that your new CNAME record needs to point to (the "value" field).
You can find the target domain name Alpha Cloud generated for you on the "Manage Web Sites" dialog.
It is labeled "Web Paths:".
It will look something like:</p>
<p class="tab">http://mycompany-production.cloud.alphasoftware.com</p>
<p>The domain name you need to provide to your registrar as the target starts after the "http://" at the beginning and becomes:</p>
<p class="tab">mycompany-production.cloud.alphasoftware.com</p>
<p>In this case, if you are using "www.mycompany.com" as your domain name, it would point to "mycompany-production.cloud.alphasoftware.com".</p>
<br/>

<h3><a id="UpdatingYourWebSite">Updating Your Alpha Cloud Web Site With Your Custom Domain Name</a></h3><br/>
<p>
After creating the CNAME record for your custom domain name, be sure to update the web site entry in Alpha Cloud with your new custom domain name.
You will set the "Host Name" field on the web site dialog (in this case to "www.mydomain.com").
</p>
<p>
For information on updating your web site see <a href="Managing Web Sites.html">Managing Web Sites</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> To enable TLS (also called SSL) for your new custom domain you will need to purchase a TLS (also called SSL) certificate and upload it to Alpha Cloud.  
This is discussed in the section <a href="Certificates.html">Alpha Cloud Certificates</a>.

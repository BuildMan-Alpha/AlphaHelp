<p>Subscriptions are are collections of Alpha Cloud resources that you manage.  
They have a status, owner, primary contact and a default region for deployment.  
Any users you authorize can manage those resources.
</p>

<p>To manage your subscription or subscriptions from within Alpha Anywhere:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click on the Alpha Cloud toolbar icon in the web control panel and select "Advanced" and then "Subscriptions" from the drop down menu.<br/><br/>

    </li>
    <br/>
	<li>To change the primary contact or default region of a subscription of which you are the owner, primary contact or authorized maintainer, make the changes right in the grid.</li>
	<li>When you have finished making changes, click "Apply Changes" to update the cloud.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<p>You can authorize additional users to manage subscription resources by clicking on the button entitled "Manage Authorized Maintainers".  
	For more information on authorized maintainers see <a href="Delegating Access.html">Delegating Access</a>.
	</p>
<br/>
<p>From this dialog you can also manage accounts, alerts, certificates, security applications, server groups and web sites for a subscription and look at usage and costs using the buttons at the bottom.
	Select the subscription (if you are authorized for more than one) and click the appropriate button.

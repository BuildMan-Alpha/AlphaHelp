        <p>By default, all messages in applications built with Alpha Anywhere are in English. These messages, however, can be changed to other languages or encapsulated in language tags and dynamically updated based on the user's language preference.</p>
        <p>Language tags are used to internationalize applications built with Alpha Anywhere. Two types of language tags are available: Language Tags and Text Dictionary tags.</p>

<description>A lookup can automatically fill in values for other fields, too. When entering data in a field with a pre-defined lookup rule, you can either type in the value or select it from the lookup window.
When you make a selection from a lookup window, the selected value, along with the values from all other columns included in the lookup, are entered in the corresponding fields in the current record. When you type a value into the lookup field, Alpha Anywhere still fills in all the fields that are part of the lookup, as long as the entered value exists in the lookup table or list.

	<note>If you do not want to be able to overwrite values copied from a lookup, enter a Skip expression that always evaluates to TRUE for each field you want to protect. For more information on skip expressions, see Skipping Over Fields.</note>

	<description>The following sections describe the five lookup styles. They all share a group of parameters that let you further customize a lookup (e.g., determine which values are accepted and the position of the lookup window).

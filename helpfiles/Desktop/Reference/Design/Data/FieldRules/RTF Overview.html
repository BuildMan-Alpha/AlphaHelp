<p class=A3Topic>RTF Overview</p>



<p>Alpha Five supports RTF (Rich Text Formatted) data in the following 
 ways:</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>A Rich Text Format field, also known&nbsp;as&nbsp;a Rich Text Field, 
 is used for storing formatted text-documents in a table, allowing you 
 to organize documents and even create an online publishing system. <a HREF="http://support.alphasoftware.com/imagesV8/UG_RTF_Field_and_Object.gif"><a class="wiki"  href="Picture" rel="">Picture</a></a></p>

<p>A Rich Text Format object, also known&nbsp;as&nbsp;a Rich Text Object, 
 provides a means for mixing and formatting text, fields, and calculations 
 using a variety of fonts, point sizes, alignment options, and other design 
 attributes.</p>



<p>Using Rich Text you can:</p>



<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1><span class=Bolded>Use 
 the Rich Text Editor to create a document or format a layout</span> : 
 Alpha Five's <a href="/Desktop/Guide/Design/View/RTF/Working with Rich Text Fields.html" title="Working with Rich Text Fields" class="wiki">&lt;span   class=Screen&gt;Rich Text Editor&lt;/span&gt;</a> gives you powerful word-processing 
 capabilities. You can use a variety of fonts, styles, and sizes, align 
 paragraphs of text, insert page breaks, find and replace words and phrases, 
 and more.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1><span class=Bolded>Import 
 and Export Rich Text</span> : The <span class=Screen>Rich Text Editor</span> 
 lets you paste Rich Text Format text into a Rich Text Field or Rich Text 
 Object. Likewise, Rich Text Fields and Objects can be copied to for use 
 in other applications, such&nbsp;as&nbsp; <span class=Screen>Microsoft 
 Word</span> and <span class=Screen>Microsoft WordPad</span>.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1><span class=Bolded>Place 
 a Rich Text Field or Rich Text Object on a layout</span> : Rich Text Objects 
 and Fields can be <a href="/Desktop/Guide/Design/View/RTF/Working with Rich Text Objects.html" title="Working with Rich Text Objects" class="wiki">placed   on any type of layout</a>. The Allow growth when printing option allows 
 the field or object to size itself, making layout design easy.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1><span class=Bolded>Add 
 fields and calculations to a Rich Text Object</span> : Alpha Five lets 
 you embed <a href="/Desktop/Guide/Design/View/RTF/Working with Conditional Rich Text Fields.html" title="Working with Conditional Rich Text Fields" class="wiki">fields   and calculations</a> into a Rich Text Object that flow seamlessly with 
 the text around it. You can also suppress blank lines caused by empty 
 fields.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1><span class=Bolded>Create 
 conditions to include or exclude paragraphs in a Rich Text Object</span> 
 : Rich Text Objects can use <a href="../../../../Guide/Design/View/RTF/Working with Conditional Rich Text Fields.html" title="Working with Conditional Rich Text Fields" class="wiki">conditional   statements</a> to conditionally include words, sentences, or paragraphs. 
 For example, you are creating a letter to send to customers in the United 
 States and in England at the beginning of July. For customers who live 
 in the United States, you want to include a paragraph that states "Have 
 a safe and happy July Fourth!" For customers in England, you want 
 to include a paragraph that states "Have a terrific summer!" 
 You can set conditions to print the appropriate paragraph based on the 
 country in which the customer lives.</p>

</li>
</ul>

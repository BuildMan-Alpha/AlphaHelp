	<topic>Top, Bottom, Nth Record and Random Record Queries</topic>
	<description>When Alpha Anywhere performs a query, sometimes you are only interested in the top or bottom x records in query. For example you may have a query that selects all donors who have given more than $1,000, sorted by size of donation. Perhaps you only want to see the 10 biggest donors. Alpha Anywhere has several functions designed to extract the top or bottom records from a query. It also has a function designed to extract every Nth record from a query. This is useful in certain mailing list applications where you want to mail to a subset of your list. Finally, Alpha Anywhere has functions that allow you to select records at random from a table.</description>

	<description>Cross-Level Queries let you run queries on all the tables in a set that has a one-to-many link. To perform a Cross-Level Query, you must use either the Query Genie or Query By Expression dialog boxes.
It is important to understand the types of questions Cross-Level Queries can answer. Using the Invoice form in the sample AlphaSports application, you can use a Cross-Level Query to answer the question: Show me all invoices that include "UnoFold Quick Dry Socks" as a line item. For each invoice found, Alpha Anywhere will show all of the line items on that invoice, not just the "UnoFold Quick Dry Socks" line item. In other words, the Cross-Level Query only filters out records at the parent level of the set, even though the filter references fields in a one-to-many child table.

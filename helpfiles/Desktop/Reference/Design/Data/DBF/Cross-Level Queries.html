<p class=A3Topic>Cross-Level Queries</p>



<p>Cross-Level Queries let you run queries on all the tables in a set that 
 has a one-to-many link. To perform a Cross-Level Query, you must use either 
 the <span class=Screen><a href="../../../../Guide/Design/View/Form/Query/Query Genie.html" title="Query Genie" class="wiki">Query Genie</a> </span>
 or <span class=Screen><a href="../../../../Guide/Design/View/Form/Query/Query by Expression.html" title="Query by Expression" class="wiki">Query By Expression</a></span> 
 dialog boxes.</p>



<p>It is important to understand the types of questions Cross-Level Queries 
 can answer. Using the Invoice form in the sample AlphaSports application, 
 you can use a Cross-Level Query to answer the question: Show me all invoices 
 that include "UnoFold Quick Dry Socks"&nbsp;as&nbsp;a line item. 
 For each invoice found, Alpha Anywhere will show all of the line items on 
 that invoice, not just the "UnoFold Quick Dry Socks" line item. 
 In other words, the Cross-Level Query only filters out records at the 
 parent level of the set, even though the filter references fields in a 
 one-to-many child table.</p>

The following example links all product records that are associated with a particular vendor record.

	<description>Child records in linked sets that do not match any parent table records do not appear in a query.
A child record can be the child of more than one parent record. This often occurs when the child table is a lookup table used for reference. For example, in the Invoice set, a particular product record matches more than one Invoice item record, since the product can be ordered on several invoices.

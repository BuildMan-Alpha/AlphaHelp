	<description>If you wish to send emails from your web application, there are 2 approaches:
</description>
	<cases>
		<case>
			<description>You or your ISP (whoever has access to the Web Application Server ) can set up an email profile that identifies the email service that you application will use.
</description>
		</case>
		<case>
			<description>You can send your emails with lower level functions that do not need a profile. These are: EMAIL_SEND(), EMAIL_SMTP_OPEN(), EMAIL_SMTP_SEND(), and EMAIL_SMTP_CLOSE().
</description>
		</case>
		
	</cases>
	<note>MAPI is not required to support email by a web application. MAPI is relevant only when opening an external client email program and this does not make sense in the context of a web application.</note>

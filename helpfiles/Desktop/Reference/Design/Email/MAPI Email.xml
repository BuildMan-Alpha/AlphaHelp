	<description>MAPI is only necessary if you want to send email using Alpha Anywhere via your "external" email client, such as  Outlook, Outlook Express, or Thunderbird. If, however, you wish to send email using Alpha Anywhere's built-in email functionality, then this is not a problem for you. MAPI is not required. Simply define your email settings in View > Settings > Email, and use EMAIL_SEND(), EMAIL_SEND2(), or any of the other email functions (except EMAIL_CLIENT_EXTERNAL() ) to send your email. 

The MAPI DLL built into Windows is just a placeholder that does nothing and cannot be accessed until there is a MAPI compliant email client installed to replace the DLL. Installing Outlook or aqnother MAPI compliant email client should install the MAPI DLL on your computer. Windows 2003 does not install any email software by default, while other versions of Windows have Outlook Express as part of the default installation.

	<topic>Dimensions of Height and Width Arguments</topic>
<description>By default, the width of an Xdialog control (that has a width argument) is dimensioned in characters. The width of a single character is based on 8 point Arial font. Likewise, the height of an Xdialog control (that has a height argument) is dimensioned in lines. Again, the height of a line is based on 8 point Arial. Fractional decimal values are allowed for width and height arguments.
The following two scripts produce similar dialog boxes.

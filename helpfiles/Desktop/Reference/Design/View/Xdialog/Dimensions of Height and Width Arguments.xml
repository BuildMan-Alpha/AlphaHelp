	<description>By default, the width of an Xdialog control (that has a width argument) is dimensioned in characters. The width of a single character is based on 8 point Arial font. Likewise, the height of an Xdialog control (that has a height argument) is dimensioned in lines. Again, the height of a line is based on 8 point Arial. Fractional decimal values are allowed for width and height arguments.
The following two scripts produce similar dialog boxes.

	<description>You may optionally dimension both width and height arguments in inches by placing a double quote (") character after the number.

	<description><![CDATA[In the previous examples, the text "Hello World" is referred to as "static text". Static text is comprised of any characters that don't have special meaning. For example, the '<' and '>' characters have a special meaning. as we have just seen, these characters indicate a button. Other characters that have special meaning are: ? <> ', ? ()', ?[] ', ? {}' , ? | ' and ? ; ' . We will discuss the meaning of each of these characters later.

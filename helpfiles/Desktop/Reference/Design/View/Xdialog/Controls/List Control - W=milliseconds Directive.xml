To test the effect of this directive, create a new Xbasic script and paste this code in. Then click on a row - a message box will show the selected value. Then hold the down arrow down and the selection will move quickly down the list, but the event which shows the current selection will not fire until you have stopped holding down the down key.
Then, repeat the exercise with te W=2000 directive removed. You will see that the message box is shown for every row.

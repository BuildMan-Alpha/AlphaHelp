	<description>Since many of the dialog boxes that appear when you use Alpha Anywhere are created using Xdialog, this setting will affect many of Alpha Anywhere's dialog boxes (such as the Query Genie and Toolbar Editor.) By increasing the font for dialog boxes from the default "Tahoma,8" to (say) "Tahoma,10", you can increase the size of many of Alpha Anywhere's dialog boxes. This will make Alpha Anywhere easier to use for vision impaired users. Compare two sections of the Quick Dialog screens shown belong. Both have the same pixel resolution. The version using the larger font produces a larger dialog box.

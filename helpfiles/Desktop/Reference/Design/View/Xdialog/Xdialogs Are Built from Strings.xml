	<topic>Xdialogs Are Built from Strings</topic>
<description>Many developers do not necessarily realize, or at least appreciate the significance of the fact, that the arguments to UI_DLG_BOX() and UI_MODELESS_DLG_BOX() are just strings that can be manipulated in Xbasic. The ramifications of this are really profound. This fact gives the developer the ability to dynamically construct dialogs on the fly. </description>

In other words, instead of defining an xdialog like this (which is how most of the examples are written):</description>	
<example><![CDATA[ui_dlg_box("Test",<<%dlg% 
Name: [.20name]; 
; 
%dlg%,<<%code% 
if a_dlg_button = "OK" then 
'do something 
end if 
%code%)]]></example>

<description>You could set up your Xdialog like this:
</description>	
<example><![CDATA[dim dlg_body as C 
dim dlg_event as C
  
dlg_body = <<%dlg% 
Name: [.20name]; 
; 
%dlg% 

dlg_event = <<%code% 
if a_dlg_button = "OK" then 
'do something 
end if 
%code% 

ui_dlg_box("Test",dlg_body,dlg_event)]]></example>	
	
</section>	
<section>
	<description>While the second example iis more verbose that the example in red, it does bring home the point that dlg_body, and dlg_event are just strings that you can easily manipulate, or dynamically construct, using Xbasic code before calling the ui_dlg_box() command.

	<title>Example</title>
<description>The following, somewhat trivial, example demonstrates how the dlg_body string is constructed dynamically using Xbasic before the dialog is shown. 

Note that this example is different than a dynamic Xdialog where controls are hidden or shown in real time 
 as the state of variables change. You can create dynamic Xdialog using the {condition} statement in the 
Xdialog body.</description>	
<example><![CDATA[dim fn as C 
dim ln as C 
dim married as L 
dim sp_fn as C 
dim sp_ln as C 

fn = "Jim" 
ln = "Jones" 
married = .t. 
sp_fn = "Sheila" 
sp_ln = "Wood" 

dim dlg_body as C 
dim dlg_married as C 
dim dlg_single as C
  
dlg_married = <<%dlg% 
First name: |[.20fn]; 
Last name: |[.20ln]; 

{lf}; 
Spouce's Name:; 
First name: | [.20sp_fn]; 
Last name: | [.20sp_ln]; 
%dlg% 

dlg_single = <<%dlg% 
First name: |[.20fn]; 
Last name: |[.20ln]; 
%dlg%
if married then 
dlg_body = dlg_married 
else 
dlg_body = dlg_single 
end if 

ui_dlg_box("Name",dlg_body)]]></example>

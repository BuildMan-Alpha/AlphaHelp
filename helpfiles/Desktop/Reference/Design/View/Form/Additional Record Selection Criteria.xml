	<description>When you are printing the data in a form or browse, the Print Layout Genie, Print Genie , Query Genie , and Query by Expressio n give you the ability to further refine the records that you will select.
These sub-selections are particularly useful for mailing list applications in which you want to send a mailing to a subset of your list. The ability to select records randomly is also very useful in statistical sampling applications.

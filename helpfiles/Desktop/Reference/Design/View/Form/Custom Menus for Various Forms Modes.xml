	<description>For example, if you specify a custom drop-down menu for the View menu selection, Query by Form, and Find by Form modes, the view menu will display when the form is in view mode. If the user selects Query by Form or Find by Form, the menu will change to the specified query menu. If no menu is specified for Query by Form or Find by Form mode, then when the user selects it, the standard menus are displayed.
You can also specify custom right click menus for when the user clicks on the form background in each of these three form modes.
You can specify custom right click menus for form fields and browse cells in View, Enter/Change, and Locked modes.

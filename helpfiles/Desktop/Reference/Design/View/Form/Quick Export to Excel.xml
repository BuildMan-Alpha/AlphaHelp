	<description>The Tools > Export to Excel command exports the current selection of records to Excel and opens Excel with the records loaded into a new worksheet. All data in the current form or browse window is exported, and the column order in Excel corresponds to the field order on the form or browse layout. The Tools > Mail merge with Word command opens up Microsoft Word and creates a blank merge document where you can place fields from the current set or table. For more information, see Microsoft Word Integration.

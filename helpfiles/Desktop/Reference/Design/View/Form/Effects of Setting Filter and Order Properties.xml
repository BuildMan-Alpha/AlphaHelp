<description>In forms in which you have saved filter/order criteria, queries act differently. While queries can be used to change the order of records that appear, they cannot be used to include records which do not satisfy the filter criteria you saved in the form's layout.</description>

	<description>For example, you have a table in which you store information about employees, and you save filter criteria in the form's layout so that the form only displays employees in the Marketing department. If you use a query to select records in which employee salaries are greater than $30,000, you will only see records of employees in the Marketing department whose salaries are greater than $30,000.

	<title>Saving filter and order criteria in a form has other effects:
</title>
	<description>Because a query is run when the form is opened, there may be a significant delay when the form is first opened. The length of the delay depends on the speed of your computer, the number of records that need to be processed, and the complexity of the query criteria. Creating indexes that Alpha Five's Lightning Query Optimization can use will, in many cases, dramatically speed up queries.
Unlike an index, a query-list is not updated as New records are entered and existing records are changed or deleted. Until you update the query, the records you enter are not placed in the correct sequence, and records entered by another user on the network do not appear. To update the query-list you can either press F5 or select Form > Refresh Display.

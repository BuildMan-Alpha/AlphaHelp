	<topic>Sending Dialog Contents via Email</topic>
<description>There are times when the output of a dialog should not go directly to a database. You may want to email the entry, for example. Here is how you would do that, assuming that once again you are starting with our Simple Dialog example.

<section>
	<description>In the Xbasic functions section of your dialog, insert this function:
</description>
	<example><![CDATA[FUNCTION sendEmail AS L (address AS C, subject as C, body AS C )
  debug(1)
  dim pm as P
  dim ps as P
  sendEmail= .F.
  IF (email_smtp_open(ps, "smtp.myserver.com", 25, "username@myserver.com","password"))
		pm.to = address
		pm.from = "myserver.com"
		pm.from_alias = "My Email Alias"
		pm.subject = subject
		pm.message = body
		sendEmail = email_smtp_send(pm, ps)
  END IF
  email_smtp_close(ps)
END FUNCTION ]]></example>
</section>	
<section>
	<description>You will need to edit the function for your server, which is why we have inserted the debug statement for you.
 In the afterDialogValidate event, insert the following code:
</description>
	<example><![CDATA[function afterDialogValidate as v (e as p)
'... comments omitted here ...
'debug(1)
 
dim address as C = "destinationUsername@destinationCompany.com"
dim subject as C = "Captured Combatant"
dim body as C
body = "NAME: " + e.dataSubmitted.NAME + crlf()
body = body + "RANK: " + e.dataSubmitted.RANK + crlf()
body = body + "SERIALNR " + e.dataSubmitted.SERIALNR + crlf()
if sendEmail(address,subject,body)
	e.javascript="alert('Submitted: "+e.dataSubmitted.NAME + ", " + e.dataSubmitted.RANK
	e.javascript=e.javascript + ", " + e.dataSubmitted.SERIALNR + ", "
else
	e.javascript="');"
end if
end function ]]></example>

		<description>You will obviously have to edit the address to be the intended, valid email.

		<description>As you can see in the picture below, there is free control over text fonts, styles, and colors.
As with other HTML editors, you can embed images and tables. You can control alignment, indents, numbering, and bulleting on a paragraph by paragraph basis.
Within tables, you can define cell properties, such as horizontal and vertical alignment, and width and height in pixels or as a percentage of table width. You can also control table properties such as Cellpadding, cellspacing, border thickness, table alignment, and table width in pixels or as a percentage of page width.

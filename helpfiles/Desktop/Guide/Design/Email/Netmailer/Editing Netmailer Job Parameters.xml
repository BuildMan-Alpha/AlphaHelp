	<title>Including Images in HTML Email
</title>
<description>When including images in HTML email, you have the following two options:
</description>	
<cases>
	<case>
		<description>Embedding the image and sending each recipient a copy of the image.
</description>
	</case>
	<case>
		<description>Placing the image on a public website and including a reference to it.
</description>
	</case>
</cases>

	
</section>	
<section>
	<description>In the first option, your HTML email message includes an image, for example, using the image tag . The embedded image potentially produces a very large message size that could bog down the server and slow down your mailing. If you select to use the image tag in this format, and do not attach the image using the embedded method, the image does not appear in the message.
In contrast, using the second option, referencing the image on a public website, for example, using the image tag , results in a smaller message size, since the image is not sent along with the message.
This is the preferred method for sending images in HTML email, however, the drawbacks are that you must have a public website to which you can upload the image, and your message recipients must connect to the website to view the image.

<title>Inserting Commands in Email
</title>	
<description>In the Netmailer Editor, clicking the Insert Command button displays the following Insert Command dialog: 
</description>	
<figure><link>images/NM_insertCommand.gif</link></figure>	
	
</section>
<section>
	<description>Netmailer supports commands that let you perform the following tasks:
</description>
<cases>
	<case>
		<description>Include conditional text in the body of the email. For example, if a "DaysOverdue" field is greater than 90, you might include a more strongly worded paragraph asking for payment.
</description>
		<example><![CDATA[[.IF days_overdue < 90]
If you have not yet sent in payment, can you please send it in as soon as possible
[.ELSE]
Your account is now more than 90 days overdue, and we would appreciate your immediate payment.
[.END_IF] ]]></example>
	</case>
	<case>
		<description>Include content in the body of the email that is dynamically loaded from disk files. This lets you include boilerplate text in your email messages. You can control which boilerplate text is loaded by an expression.
</description>
		
	</case>
	<case>
		<description>Suppress lines in the email that are blank. For example, if you include a Company, and an Address2 field in an email, and the field contains no data, Netmailer can suppress the blank line.
</description>
		<example><![CDATA[<Firstname|>> <Lastname|>>
<Company|>> [Suppress Blank Line]
<Address_1|>>
<Address_2|>> [Suppress Blank Line]
<City|>>, <State|>> <Zip|>> ]]></example>
	</case>
	<case>
		<description>Include fields from one-to-many linked child tables. This option is only available if the data source for your Netmailer job is a set which has one-to-many child tables.
</description>
		<example><![CDATA[[.ONE_MANY:Invoice_Items]
<Product_id|>> <Price||10|2>>
[.END_ONE_MANY] ]]></example>
	</case>

	<description>The Restore Default File Name for Print to File action restores the default file name for print to file for your computer.

To get to the Restore Default File Name for Print to File option, open a workspace and then go to View > Code Editor. Once the Editor is open you can Select an Action by doing Right Click > Genies > XBasic Script Genie. Scroll down to Reports (Print, Preview, Send, etc.) under the category list and then choose Restore Default File Name for Print to File from the list of actions that appear on the right of the Select Action dialog box.

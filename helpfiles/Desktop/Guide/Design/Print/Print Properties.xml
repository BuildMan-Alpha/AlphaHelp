<description>Report, Letter, and Label layouts let you save Page and Print properties directly in the layout. This lets you set margins, decide whether the layout should print in landscape or portrait mode, and choose the paper-size and printer on which the layout prints. For example, you can set properties in your sales Report so that it always prints in landscape mode.</description>

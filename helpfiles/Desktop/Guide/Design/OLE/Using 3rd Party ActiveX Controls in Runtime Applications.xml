	<topic>Using 3rd Party ActiveX Controls in Runtime Applications </topic>
	<description>Users of Runtime applications that use 3rd party ActiveX controls do not own a licensed copy of the ActiveX control. as a result, even though the particular ActiveX control is physically present on the user's machine and is properly registered, when a user tries to run the application, he gets an error saying that the control is not licensed.</description>

	<description>If the ActiveX control has been placed on a Form, the form must be edited using Alpha Five Version 7 build 3996-3019 or above and then resaved. You must make some small change to the form to make it "dirty" or else Alpha Five will not resave it. This will save the form with an embedded copy of the developer license key and the form will then run correctly in a Runtime application. The Runtime application must be run using build 3996-3019 or later.

If the ActiveX control is loaded in an Xbasic script (for example, it may have been placed on an Xdialog), you must edit the script and add the following Xbasic command:

<example><![CDATA[ole.AddLicense(ProgramId, LicenseNumber) ]]></example>

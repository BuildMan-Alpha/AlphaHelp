	<description>You write Xbasic scripts in the Code Editor. The Code Editor is a multi-tabbed window that lets you edit multiple scripts at the same time. It always includes at least one tab called the Interactive window where you can test individual lines of Xbasic code and see immediate results.
The Code Editor lets you write scripts in two ways. You can use the graphical Action Scripting method, or you can type in Xbasic commands. For more information on Action Scripting, see the Introduction to Action Scripting book.

	<description>When you save a script or function, Alpha Anywhere checks syntax and issues a warning if you are trying to save code that has syntax errors.
If you are editing multiple global scripts and functions, you can save the "desktop" and then later restore the "desktop" to quickly reopen all of the scripts and functions that you were editing. Select File > Desktop > Save Desktop in the Code Editor. To restore the desktop and the Code Editor to its previous state, select File > Desktop > Restore Desktop.

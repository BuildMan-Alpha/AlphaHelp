		<note>While you are free to use any string that you want in the %marker% delimiter, we recommend that you use %dlg% as the delimiter for the "Dialog Format" string, and %code% as the delimiter for the "Code" string in a UI_DLG_BOX()command. If you use these specially named delimiters, Alpha Anywhere will give you bubble-help in the Code Editor while you are editing these strings.</note>

		<description>The Script Recorder records your actions as you use Alpha Anywhere and it writes the Xbasic code that corresponds to your actions. Not every action that you perform interactively with Alpha Anywhere is recorded, but most actions are recorded. It is an excellent way to learn Xbasic.</description>

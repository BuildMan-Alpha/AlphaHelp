			<title>Overview</title>
			<description>The Activate an Object action gives focus to an object in an open window. This is a useful action for guiding the user, as well as for repetitive data entry.
Performing an activate action multiple times on a form allows you to step a user through a process, giving focus to subsequent required fields so that the user does not need to tab or click to get to necessary fields.

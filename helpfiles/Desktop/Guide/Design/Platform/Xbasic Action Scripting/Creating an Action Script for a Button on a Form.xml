	<description>The scripts we've been working with so far are not associated with any particular "events." To run the "Lesson1" script, you double-click it in the Control Panel. This script is called a Global Script because it can be run at any time.</description>

However, consider this scenario: You create a form and put a button on it. When the user clicks the button, you would like a script to run. When the user clicks the button, the button's OnClick event fires. Alpha Anywhere lets you automatically run a script whenever an event is fired. A script that runs when an event occurs is called an Event Script.

You can attach scripts to a variety of events. For example, a form's OnSave event fires when a record is saved, or its OnActivate event fires when the form receives focus. Refer to Field Rule Field Events and Field Rule Record Events for a full list of events.

In this lesson you are going to focus on the most common event, a button's OnPush event.

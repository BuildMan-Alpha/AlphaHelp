			<description>The Display 'Print/Send Selected Records' Dialog action displays the Print Layout Genie allowing the user to print, preview, email, or save the selected record using any layout they choose. It is similar to the "Display 'Print Current Record' Dialog" Action except it will print all the currently selected records. Appropriate options are also presented to the user for the different choices. These options can be saved to avoid having to re-select them each time.</description>
		<note>This action must be attached to a form or browse to work.</note>

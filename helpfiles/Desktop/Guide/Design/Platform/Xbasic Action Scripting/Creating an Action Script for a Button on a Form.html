<p class=A3Topic>Creating an Action Script for a Button on a Form</p>



<p>The scripts we've been working with so far are not associated with any 
 particular "events." To run the "Lesson1" script, 
 you double-click it in the <span class=Screen>Control Panel</span>. This 
 script is called a <span class=Bolded>Global</span> <span class=Bolded>Script</span> 
 because it can be run at any time.</p>



<p>However, consider this scenario: You create a form and put a button 
 on it. When the user clicks the button, you would like a script to run. 
 When the user clicks the button, the button's <span class=Code1>OnClick</span> 
 event fires. Alpha Anywhere lets you automatically run a script whenever an 
 event is fired. A script that runs when an event occurs is called an Event 
 Script.</p>



<p>You can attach scripts to a variety of events. For example, a form's 
 <span class=Code1>OnSave</span> event fires when a record is saved, or 
 its <span class=Code1>OnActivate</span> event fires when the form receives 
 focus. Refer to <a href="../../Data/FieldRules/Field Rule Field Events.html" title="Field Rule Field Events" class="wiki">Field   Rule Field Events</a> and <a href="../../Data/FieldRules/Field Rule Record Events.html" title="Field Rule Record Events" class="wiki">Field   Rule Record Events</a> for a full list of events.</p>



<p>In this lesson you are going to focus on the most common event, a button's 
 <span class=Code1>OnPush</span> event.</p>

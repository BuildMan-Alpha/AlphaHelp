			<title>Overview</title>
			<description>The Hide Object(s) action hides objects on a window. When the action is performed, the selected objects are removed from sight. This action is contextually useful in order to remove unnecessary objects (as dictated through user interaction) from sight. You can see this action in use throughout Alpha Five, including the Script Genie, as Alpha will often hide entry fields depending on the choices you made previously.</description>

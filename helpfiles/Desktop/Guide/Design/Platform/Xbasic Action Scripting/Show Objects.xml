	<description>The Show Object(s) action reveals objects previously hidden in a window. This action is contextually useful in order to reveal pertinent objects (as dictated through user interaction). You can see this action in use throughout Alpha Anywhere, including the Script Genie, as Alpha will often reveal entry fields depending on the choices you made previously.</description>

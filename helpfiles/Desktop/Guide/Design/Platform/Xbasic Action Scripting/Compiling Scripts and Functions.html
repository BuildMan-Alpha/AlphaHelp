<p class=A3Topic>Compiling Scripts and Functions</p>



<p>Alpha Five lets you compile your scripts and functions into a Compiled 
 Script Library. The Compiled Script Library is a file with an .AEX extension.</p>

 your scripts by placing compiler instructions in their source code. See

<p class=A5>Why would you want to compile your scripts and functions into 
 an AEX file?</p>



<p>Compiling scripts and functions into an AEX file is primarily of interest 
 to developers who have developed libraries of scripts and functions that 
 they want use with a lot of different databases, or who have scripts and 
 functions that they want to protect, so that no one can see their source 
 code. In addition, code in a compiled library will execute slightly faster.</p>



<p>There are three ways in which you might use AEX files:</p>



<p class=A5>Auto-Load Compiled Library</p>



<p>When you open a database, Alpha Five checks to see if there is a file 
 with the same name&nbsp;as&nbsp;the database, with an AEX extension. If 
 so, Alpha Five loads the AEX file when the database is opened. You can 
 prevent the auto-load library from loading in the <span class=Button>View 
 > Settings</span> dialog box, under <span class=Button>Preferences 
 > Auto-Load Library</span>. The following example shows how you might 
 use the Auto-Load Compiled Library.</p>



<p>You have developed an application called <span class=Code1>MyApp</span> 
 (the database is called <span class=Code1>MyApp.adb</span> ). You are 
 now ready to distribute your application to your customers, but you want 
 to make sure that they cannot see any of the source code for your application.</p>



<ol start=1>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>You compile all of 
 the scripts and functions in your application (the scripts and functions 
 are stored in <span class=Code1>MyApp.alb</span> ) into a Compiled Library 
 called <span class=Code1>MyAppAEX</span>. Make sure that you save MyAppAEX 
 in the same folder&nbsp;as&nbsp; <span class=Code1>MyApp.adb</span>.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Next, you backup 
 your original copy of <span class=Code1>MyApp</span> (this is VERY important). 
 Alternatively, you can select <span class=Button>Code > Export > 
 Scripts</span>, then save your scripts in a text file that can be re-imported.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Then, you delete 
 all of the scripts and functions shown in the <span class=Screen>Code</span> 
 tab of the <span class=Screen>Control Panel</span>. <span class=Bolded>Do 
 not delete operations</span>.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Next, you close the 
 <span class=Code1>MyApp</span> database, and then re-open it.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p>When Alpha Five re-opens <span class=Code1>MyApp.adb</span>, it will 
 auto-load <span class=Code1>MyAppAEX</span>, and all of the scripts and 
 functions in your compiled library will be available. However, your customers 
 will not see any scripts and functions in the <span class=Screen>Control 
 Panel</span>.</p>



<p class=A5>Attached Compiled Libraries</p>



<p>Select the <span class=Button>File > Database Properties</span> command. 
 The <span class=Screen>Database Properties</span> dialog box has a tab 
 called <span class=Screen>Compiled Libraries</span>. You can specify the 
 names of any AEX files that you want to load when the database is loaded. 
 You do not need to include the auto-load library in this list.</p>



<p class=A5>Addins</p>



<p>An Addin is just an AEX file that has been placed in a special folder 
 in your Alpha Five program folder - the <span class=Code1>addins_installed</span> 
 folder. The scripts and functions in an Addin are globally available in 
 Alpha Five, regardless of the database that is currently loaded, or whether 
 a database is loaded. In effect, an Addin is part of Alpha Five, and is 
 indistinguishable from the built-in Alpha Five functions.</p>



<p class=Note><span class=Note><img src="images/icon_warning.gif"
									x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
									style="border: none;
											width: 37px;
											height: 33px;
											float: none;
											border-style: none;
											border-style: none;"
									width=37
									height=33
									border=0>Note</span> : Much of the 
 functionality of Alpha Five V5 was developed&nbsp;as&nbsp;Addins. Now, 
 you can create your own Addins.</p>



<p>The <span class=Button>Tools > Addin Manager</span> command displays 
 the <span class=Screen>Addin Manager</span> dialog box. </p>



<p class=Pix><img src="images/Addin_Manager_dialog_box.gif"
					x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
					style="border: none;
							float: none;
							width: 368px;
							height: 304px;
							border-style: none;
							border-style: none;"
					width=368
					height=304
					border=0></p>



<p>When an Addin is unloaded, the AEX file is moved from the <span class=Code1>Addins_installed</span> 
 folder to the <span class=Code1>Addins_disabled</span> folder.</p>



<p>The <span class=Button>Explore</span> button shows you what scripts 
 and functions are in each Addin library.</p>

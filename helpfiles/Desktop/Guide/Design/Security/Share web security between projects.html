			Sharing web security between projects</h1>
<br />
If you are using Active Link tables to upsize your security database to a SQL database (see <a class="wiki"  href="/a5/Using%20SQL%20tables%20in%20Web%20Security.pdf" rel="">Using SQL tables in Web Security</a>), multiple Active link tables can connect to the same SQL tables.  Therefore more than one project could share the same security data tables for users and groups.  Each can still have different page and component permissions and configuration as that information is saved in separate text files published with each project.<br />
<br />
Since all projects will have the same groups and users, that may require the developer to do some planning since some groups may not be applicable to every project.  One solution is to code the group names to indicate which project should use them. If the groups are then shown on a web form for selection / assignment, the list could be filtered.<br />
<br />
A more complex method would be to share only the users tables (Websecurity_Expired, Websecurity_Users)  and create unique groups, members tables for each project (websecurity_groups, websecurity_members).  The web security would even work with some tables as Active link and others as DBF, although it is preferable to place them all in SQL if you are using SQL. But that may be way more complex than many developers would want to tackle.<br />
<br />
Another advantage of Active Link involves the desktop side of the project.  If the desktop development can connect to the same SQL database that is used by the server, the desktop Users and Groups form actually sees the same live data as seen by the web application.  This gives an option in deployment to set up a simple desktop app using a runtime or full Apha Five installation on the server to edit users instead of building a web interface.  This is a good option for intranet apps where an administrator manages all user access.<br />

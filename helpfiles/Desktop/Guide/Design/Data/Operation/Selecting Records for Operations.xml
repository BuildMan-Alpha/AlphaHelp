	<description>Record selection options include a range of record numbers, selected record numbers, range of key values, and selected key values. For example, you can specify a starting and ending record number (e.g. records 10 through 90), or a starting and ending key value (e.g. last names between "Jones" and "Marks").
Other record selection options include, including the ability to select the "top x records" or "top x percent of records" in a query. For example, you may want to export just the top 100 records for "State = 'MA' " to Excel.

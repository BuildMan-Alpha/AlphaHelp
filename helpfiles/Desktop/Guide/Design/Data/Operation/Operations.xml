<description>For example, you want to mail a sales flyer to all customers in your Customer table. There is a possibility that some customers have been entered twice or more and you do not want to mail duplicates. Before printing Labels, you can perform a Mark/Delete operation to delete the duplicates. Or, even easier, use the Delete Duplicate Records Genie to streamline the process.

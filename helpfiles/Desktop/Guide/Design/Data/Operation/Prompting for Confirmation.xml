	<description>After an Operation has run, the confirmation dialog that Alpha Anywhere displays includes a button that lets you view the results of the Operation. For example, after an Export Operation, the confirmation dialog lets you open the file created by the Export. After an Update Operation has run, the confirmation dialog lets you browse the table that was just updated. </description>

<description>The Mark/Delete Operation uses the criteria you specify to selectively mark, unmark, or delete records. You can use this operation to mark, unmark, or delete all of the records in the current range, or just the duplicate records in the current range.
For example, you have a table which stores club-membership information, and you want to compile a list of members who are no longer active in the organization.

		<description>When viewing records in a form or Browse, the status bar indicates marked records by displaying a check mark. When creating filter expressions, you can select just the marked records by using the expression MARKED(), and when using the Filter Card, you can select only marked records. Each method lets you print, view, or process only marked records.</description>

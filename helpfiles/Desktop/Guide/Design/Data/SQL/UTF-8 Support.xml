<description>Alpha Anywhere now has improved support for UTF-8 characters.
All data that is accessed from SQL databases using AlphaDAO are now returned in UTF-8 form. Previously, data accessed from SQL databases was translated to ansi format.
When using data from SQL databases in Xdialogs, you will need to be conscious of whether of whether the data is in UTF-8 form or not. The new {encoding=utf8} and {encoding=ascii} can be used to automatically convert data when it is displayed in an Xdialog. See What's New in Xdialog for more details.
You can also use the convert_utf8_to_acp() function to convert data from UTF-8 to ansi format. The corresponding convert_acp_to_utf8() function converts from ansi to UTF-8.

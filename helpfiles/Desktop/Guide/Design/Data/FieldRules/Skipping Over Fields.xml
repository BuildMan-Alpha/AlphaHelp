	<description>A Skip expression can conditionally make a field read-only. If the expression evaluates to TRUE (.T.), the field is skipped; otherwise, it is not.
For example, if you have a table that contains both billing address fields and shipping address fields for customers, you can use a Skip expression to skip the shipping address fields if the first line of the shipping address field reads "Same."
You might want to make a field conditional based on who is logged on.

]]></example>

	<description>You may want to always skip some fields. Field values set by Field Rules ( Calculated, Auto-Increment, Default, and Lookup) are often skipped, so the user does not change them.
To always skip a field, specify a Skip expression that is always TRUE (e.g., .T.).

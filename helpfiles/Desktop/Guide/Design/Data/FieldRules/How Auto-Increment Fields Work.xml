	<description>If there are NO records in the table, the initial value in the field (the so called 'seed' value) can be set by specifying a " default value " field rule and setting the " set value at start of data entry ".
If there are existing records in the table, then when the user starts to enter a new record, Alpha Anywhere shows a "likely" value for the auto-increment field. This "likely" value is the previous high value in the field plus one.
The user if free to change this "likely" value as long as he enters a number that is higher than any existing value. If the user breaks the sequence and enters a higher value than the likely value, then the sequence for all subsequent records starts with the value entered by the user.
The user can never change the value in a previously saved record.
The user can never override the "likely" value with a number that is lower than the previously recorded high value for the field.
The reason that the value that displays when the user starts entering a new record is called the "likely" value is that it is not really known until the record is saved what the value will be. For example, say a table has 4 records and two users begin entering a new record. User 1 will see the value of "5" in his new record. User 1 has not yet saved his record. User 2 now starts a new record. he also sees a value of "5". If user 2 saves before user 1 then his record will get the value of "5". If user 1 then saves, the "5" in the record will change to "6".

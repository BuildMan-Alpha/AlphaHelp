	<description>Merely adding a field to a table and giving it a field rule calculation expression does not fill the field with values. A field rule does not calculate until one of three events occurs.</description>

	<description>To re-evaluate field rules for a table:</description>
	<steps>
		<step>
			<description>Select the table in the Table/Sets tab of the Control Panel.</description>
		</step>
		<step>
			<description>Select Table > Utilities > Recalculate Calc Fields (Field Rules).</description>
		</step>
	</steps>
	<note>When running an operation that updates records in a table, Alpha Anywhere updates only the calculated fields directly affected by changing table field values. Alpha Five does not update calculated fields that depend on the contents of other calculated fields. Adding the following piece of code in your operation will solve the problem.</note>

	<title>Alpha Anywhere Database Structure</title>
	<description>A database is a collection of data. Databases are used for sorting, retrieving, or in some way manipulating the information stored in the database.
Information in a database is stored in files called tables. Each table consists of a series of records, where each record represents one person, inventory item, transaction, and such.
Each record has several fields, and each field contains one item of data. For example, in a table of employees, there is one record for each employee, and individual items of information about that employee are contained in fields for that record. Information like name, address, social security number, and such, might make up the fields for the employee's record.

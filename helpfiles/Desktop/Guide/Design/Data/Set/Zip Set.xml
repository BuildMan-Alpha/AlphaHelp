</description>

</description>
	</step>
	<step>

	</step>
	<step>
		<description>Display the Options tab.
</description>
	</step>

</description>
	</step>
	<step>
		<description>Optionally, clear Include Indexes, if you do not want to include indexes. Indexes can make a zip file significantly larger. The indexes can be recreated without loss of information later.

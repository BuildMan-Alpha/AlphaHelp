<p class=A3Topic>Using Sets</p>



<p>With sets you can link logically related tables together&nbsp;as&nbsp;if 
 they were a single table. A set reduces the storage of redundant information, 
 making your data easier to update, less prone to errors, and more efficient. 
 Sets also offer options not available with single tables.</p>



<p>In almost every case, Alpha Anywhere treats sets exactly like tables. You 
 can create layouts and perform and save operations for a set. When entering 
 data into a form designed for a set, the information is automatically 
 placed into the correct table along with the necessary linking information.</p>



<p class=A5>How Sets Work</p>



<p>When you create a set, you link pairs of tables together using either 
 <a href="/Desktop/Guide/Design/Data/Set/Create and Restructure Sets.html" title="Create and Restructure Sets" class="wiki">one-to-one or one-to-many   links</a>. To better understand how linking works, you must first recognize 
 that you build a set starting with a single table, called the Primary 
 Table. You link the other tables, called Child Tables, to the Primary 
 Table. Tables linked from the child tables are then called Grandchild 
 Tables, and so on down the hierarchy.</p>

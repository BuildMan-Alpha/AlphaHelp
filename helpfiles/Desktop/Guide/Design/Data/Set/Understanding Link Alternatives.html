<p class=A3Topic>Understanding Link Alternatives</p>



<p class=A5><a name=One_to_One_Links>One-to-One&nbsp;Links</a></p>



<p>A one-to-one link describes a relationship in which there is only one 
 matching child for each parent record. In the case of the Invoice set, 
 the invoice and customer tables have a one-to-one relationship. For each 
 invoice there can only be one customer. The link between the Invoice table 
 and the Customer table is the <span class=Code1>Cust_NO</span> field which 
 is contained in both the Invoice table and the Customer table.</p>



<p>When you create a set in Alpha Five, the <span class=Screen>Set Editor</span> 
 displays the set's structure using a set diagram. In the diagram, one-to-one 
 links are shown&nbsp;as&nbsp;a single line between the parent and the 
 child.</p>



<p class=A5><a name=One_to_Many_Links>One-to-Many&nbsp;Links</a></p>



<p>A one-to-many link describes a relationship in which there can be multiple 
 matching records for each parent record. In the case of the Invoice set, 
 the invoice and items tables have a one-to-many relationship. For each 
 invoice there can be multiple line items. The link between the Invoice 
 table and the Items table is the <span class=Code1>Inv_No</span> field 
 which is contained in both the Invoice and Items databases</p>



<p>In the Alpha Five <span class=Screen>Set Editor</span>, one-to-many 
 links are shown&nbsp;as&nbsp;a double line between the parent and the 
 child.</p>



<p>One-to-many links can be used with Alpha Five's referential integrity. 
 This feature helps ensure that child records do not become unlinked from 
 their parent. For more information, refer to <a href="../Tutorials/Alpha Five User Guide (Desktop)/Using Sets/Create and Restructure Sets.html#Referential_Integrity" title="Create and Restructure Sets" class="wiki">Referential   Integrity</a> in the previous section.</p>

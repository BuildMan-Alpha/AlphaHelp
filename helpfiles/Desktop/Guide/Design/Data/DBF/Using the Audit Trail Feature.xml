	<description>Alpha Anywhere writes out an ASCII file which is an audit trail of all changes made to a record. The audit trail shows the date and time of the change, the original value in the field, and the new value in the field.
To turn on the audit trail feature, you put the command: Addin.run("audit_trail") in the record's CanSaveRecord event. Also, if you want to keep track of deleted records, put Addin.run("audit_trail_deleteRecord") in the record's CanDeleteRecord event.

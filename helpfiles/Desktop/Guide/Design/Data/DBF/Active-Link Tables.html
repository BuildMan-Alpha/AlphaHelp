			<h1>Active-Link Tables</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><b>Note: Active-Link tables are available in the 'Platinum' edition of Version 9, plus all editions of Version 10 and newer.</b></p>
<p>Active-Link tables allow you to work with data in SQL tables. An active-link table is a local Alpha Five table that is dynamically populated with 
data from a remote SQL database. Any changes that you make to the local 
active-link table are immediately persisted (i.e. saved) to the remote database. This 
means that you can build Alpha Five forms that update, insert and delete 
records in remote SQL tables. In addition, it means that you can use your 
knowledge of how to work with tables using Xbasic to manipulate data in 
remote SQL databases. </p>

<p>From the Xbasic perspective, an active-link table is 
the same as a regular Alpha Five table. All of the Xbasic methods that you 
can use on a&nbsp; native Alpha Five table can be used on an active-link 
table. For example, <tbl>.change_begin(), <tbl>.enter_begin(), <tbl>.fetch_next(), 
etc. all work.</p>

<p>The following describes what we mean when we say that an active-link table is 
'dynamically' populated with data from a remove SQL database:</p>
<p>Say you define an 
active-link table on a SQL table that has 50 million rows. When you open the 
active-link table, Alpha Five will dynamically create a local table (i.e. a .dbf 
file) and it will fetch the first 50 rows from the SQL table that satisfy the 
SQL SELECT statement's WHERE clause.&nbsp; Since only a small subset of the rows in 
the SQL table are being brought down from the server, this will happen quickly. 
If you then move the record pointer past the last fetched record, Alpha Five 
will go back the server to get the next batch of records. </p>
<p>The size of the batch 
can be set in the active-link table definition. Generally, Alpha Five will have 
pre-fetched data before you actually need it, so when you open a browse on an 
active-link table and hit page down repeatedly, the browse will feel responsive 
because Alpha Five will already have the data in its cache. The exception will 
be if the user tries to navigate to the last record in the browse. Alpha Five 
will then have to fully populate the local cache, and in the case of a 50 
million record table, this will take a very long time! (Of course, should you 
actually inadvertently try to navigate to the last record, the status bar will 
show a progress meter with a cancel button that will allow you to cancel the 
operation, rather than forcing you to wait until 50 million records are fetched 
from the server.) Because of this, an 
application that is built on active-link tables should always ensure that there 
is a suitable WHERE clause in the SQL statement for the active-link table. 
Typically, this WHERE clause might include an argument so that you can prompt 
for a value, or pass a value in programmatically, when the table is opened. </p>
<p>For 
example, the following WHERE clause contains an argument for the state value: 
WHERE state = :whatstate.</p>
<p>The following Interactive window session shows some examples. Assume that 
the local Alpha Five table called 'mysql_customer' is an active-link table 
that is bound to the 'customers' table in a MySQL database. Assume also, 
that the SELECT statement defined for this active-link table has a WHERE 
clause that uses an argument. e.g. SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = :whatcity.</p>
<p>Notice how the table.open() method allows you to pass in argument value.</p>
<p class="xbasic"><br>
<br>
dim args as sql::arguments<br>
args.set("whatCity","paris")<br>
t = table.open("mysql_customers",args)<br>
?t.city <br>
= "Paris "<br>
<br>
?t.records_get()<br>
= 2<br>
<br>
t.close()</p>
<p class="xbasic"><br>
args.set("whatCity","london")<br>
t = table.open("mysql_customers",args)<br>
?t.city <br>
= "London "<br>
<br>
?t.records_get()<br>
= 6<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you executed the table.open() method without passing in arguments, 
Alpha Five would display a dialog box prompting for the missing argument 
values.</p>
<h2>Creating Active Link Tables</h2>
<p>To create a new active-link tables, you select the Tables/Sets tab on the 
Control Panel, and then either right click on the white space on the Control 
Panel and select New Table, Active Link Table... from the menu, or click the 
'New' button at the top of the Control Panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0" id="table43">
	<tr>
		<td style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
		Note: Yet another way to create multiple active-link tables is from the 
		Welcome screen when Alpha Five first starts up. The 'Create a database 
		from linked data' option allows you to create a new Alpha Five database 
		and populate it with many active-link tables in a single step.

		<p class="ImageCaption">&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alpha Five allows you to create multiple active-link tables, or a single 
table. The single table option gives you a great deal of control over how the 
active-link table is defined. The multiple table option makes default selections 
for all of the options. In many cases these default options will meet your 
needs. Even if you select the multiple table option, you can always go back 
later on and edit the definition of an individual active-link table definition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0" id="table35">
	<tr>
		<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">

	</tr>
</table>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of which option you choose, the first screen of the Active-Link 
Table genie allows you to specify how to connect to the SQL database you want to 
link. You can either specify a named connection string, or an ad hoc connection 
string. It is strongly recommended that you use named connection strings when 
you define your active-link tables. If your active-link tables use named 
connection strings, you can point an entire application from a development 
version of your database to a production version of your database by editing the 
named connection string.</p>
<p>Note: You can manage named connection strings by selecting the Tools, 
External Databases command from the menu when the Control Panel has focus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

	</tr>
</table>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Creating a Single Active-Link Table</h3>
<p>When you select the single active-link table option, the next screen of the 
genie allows you to specify the SELECT SQL statement that Alpha Five will use to 
retrieve records from your SQL database and populate the active-link table.</p>
<p>If you choose the 'Columns from a table or view' option, then you can select 
the table, and the columns from that table, and Alpha Five will automatically 
generate the SQL SELECT statement for you.</p>
<p>If you choose the 'Custom SQL' option, then you can enter you own SQL SELECT 
statement, or you can specify a stored procedure.</p>
<p>When specifying a custom SQL statement, you must specify if you are using 
portable or native SQL. By using portable SQL, you ensure that you can easily 
move your application from one vendor's database to another without having to 
make any modifications to your application. Alpha Five automatically converts 
portable SQL statements to the correct syntax before sending the statement to 
the database engine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0" id="table37">
	<tr>
		<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
		<p class="ImageCaption"><img border="0" src="images/newina20.jpg"></td>
	</tr>

		<p class="ImageCaption">The Create Active-Link Tables Genie - Page2</td>
	</tr>
</table>
						<p class="ImageCaption">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alpha Five automatically determines the field type and size of every field in 
the active-link table. There may be situations in which you want to override 
Alpha Five's decisions. For example you might have a long text field in the SQL 
table that you happen to know contains HTML text. By default, Alpha Five will 
create a Memo field in the active-link table to display this field. However, you 
might want to change this to an HTMLMemo field so that when the data in this 
active-link table is viewed in a Form or Browse layout, it will properly render 
the HTML. You might also want to change the field name that the active link 
table uses for a particular field.</p>
<p>To override the field definitions in the active-link table, click the 
'Override Field Definitions' button. The following dialog is displayed:</p>
<p class="ImageCaption">&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0" id="table38">
	<tr>
		<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
		<p class="ImageCaption"><img border="0" src="images/newina21.jpg"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
		<p class="ImageCaption">The Create Active-Link Tables Genie - Specifying 
		Field Definitions of the Active-Link Table</td>
	</tr>
</table>
						<p class="ImageCaption">&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the screen shown above, the field name of the 'City' column in the 
active-link table has been changed to 'CityName' (but the field definition was 
not overwritten).</p>
<p class="ImageCaption">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next genie screen (show below) allows you to configure the UPDATE, INSERT 
and DELETE SQL statements that are used to update the remote SQL table when the 
user edits, deletes or inserts records in the active-link table.</p>
<p>You can configure the active-link table so that updates are disallowed, while 
still allowing inserts and deletes, or any other combination, by checking the 
'Allow updates', 'Allow inserts' and 'Allow deletes' checkboxes.</p>
<p>If you check the 'Active-line table is read-only' checkbox, then the 'Allow 
updates', 'Allow inserts' and 'Allow deletes' checkboxes are all set to false.</p>
<p>In addition to turning off updates completely, you can also selectively mark 
certain fields as read-only by checking the 'Some fields are read-only' box and 
then specifying the field list.</p>
<p>In most situations, you can accept all of the default settings on this page. 
Alpha Five will automatically generate the appropriate SQL UPDATE, INSERT and 
DELETE statements. However you have a lot of flexibility in configuring how data 
is written to the remote SQL table by defining your own UPDATE, INSERT and 
DELETE statements. If you want to call stored procedures when data is written to 
the remote table, then you must specify the SQL yourself - you cannot use the 
auto-generated option.</p>
						<p>Note: If your active-link table is based on a JOIN 
						(i.e. it selects data from multiple remote tables), then 
						the active-link table is automatically set to read-only. 
						Only active-link tables that select data from a single 
						table can be updateable. If you want to create a form 
						that updates multiple remote tables, then you should 
						create active-link tables for each remote table and then 
						combine the tables into a Set (see the Tables/Sets tab 
						of the Control Panel). You can then build a Form that is 
						based on your Set and that will allow you to do updates 
						against multiple remote tables.</p>

<p>The final page of the Active-Link Genie (when the single active-link table 
option is selected) is shown below.</p>

<h3>Behind the Scene on Active-Link Table Definitions</h3>
<p>The active-link table definition is stored in a file with the same name as 
the active-link table, but with a .dbp extension.<p>When you define an active-link table, the definition includes the 
following properties:<p>SELECT command - this is the SQL command that is 
used to query the server database for the records that will be displayed in 
the active-link table. This can be a standard SQL SELECT command ( that 
extracts data from a single table, or joins multiple tables), or it could be 
a stored procedure. For example:<p class="xbasic">SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE country = 'USA'<p>&nbsp;<p>Note that the SELECT command can include arguments. 
If so, the argument values can be passed in when the active-link table is 
opened, or Alpha Five can prompt for the argument values. If a form, browse, 
report layout, or operation is based on an active-link table that uses 
arguments, then when the layout is opened, you can pass in the argument values.<p>&nbsp;<p>COUNT 
command - this is the SQL command that is used to return the count of the 
number of records returned by the SELECT command. Note that the WHERE clause 
    for the COUNT command must match the WHERE clause for the SELECT command. For example:<p class="xbasic">
SELECT count(*) from customers WHERE country = 'USA'</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE command - this is the SQL command that is used to save changes that 
are made to data in the active-link table to the server database. This could be 
a SQL UPDATE command, or it could be a stored procedure. The syntax of the 
UPDATE command determines whether Alpha Five uses optimistic locking techniques 
to prevent users from overwriting data or not. The UPDATE command can be a 
complete UPDATE SQL statement, a stored procedure, or just a WHERE clause. If 
you just specify just a WHERE clause, then Alpha Five will automatically generate the 
rest of the UPDATE statement based on the fields that were actually edited. By 
default, when you create an active-link table, the UPDATE command contains just 
the WHERE clause. For example, here is the UPDATE command for an active-link 
table that links the Customers table in the sample Access Northwind database:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">WHERE (CustomerID = :old.CustomerID OR (CustomerID IS NULL AND :old.CustomerID 
IS NULL)) AND CompanyName = :old.CompanyName AND (ContactName = :old.ContactName 
OR (ContactName IS NULL AND :old.ContactName IS NULL)) AND (ContactTitle = :old.ContactTitle 
OR (ContactTitle IS NULL AND :old.ContactTitle IS NULL)) AND (Address = :old.Address 
OR (Address IS NULL AND :old.Address IS NULL)) AND (City = :old.City OR (City IS 
NULL AND :old.City IS NULL)) AND (Region = :old.Region OR (Region IS NULL AND :old.Region 
IS NULL)) AND (PostalCode = :old.PostalCode OR (PostalCode IS NULL AND :old.PostalCode 
IS NULL)) AND (Country = :old.Country OR (Country IS NULL AND :old.Country IS 
NULL)) AND (Phone = :old.Phone OR (Phone IS NULL AND :old.Phone IS NULL)) AND 
(Fax = :old.Fax OR (Fax IS NULL AND :old.Fax IS NULL))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this example, you will note that the argument values have :old prefixes. 
This indicates that the argument will be populated with the original value in 
the field (before any changes are made to the field). </p>
<p>Note that this UPDATE command omits the code to set field values. Alpha Five 
will auto-generate it.</p>
<p>You could change the UPDATE command to:</p>
<p class="xbasic">WHERE (CustomerID = :old.CustomerID)<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>By doing this, however, you have effectively turned off optimistic record 
locking because the update will no longer fail if the record has been edited by 
another user.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example in which a complete SQL UPDATE statement has been 
specified:</p>
<p class="xbasic">UPDATE customers SET Contactname = :new.Contactname, city = :New.City 
WHERE (customerID = :old.CustomerID)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this ultra simple UPDATE command there is no optimistic record locking, 
and only the 'contactname' and 'city' fields are updated. Effectively, all of the 
other fields on the active-link table have been made read-only!</p>
<h2>Editing an Active-Link Table Definition</h2>
<p>To edit an active-link table, right click on the table in the Tables/Sets tab 
of the Control Panel and select Active Link Table, Edit Active-Link 
Definition... from the menu.</p>
<p>The same genie that is used to create a new active-link table is displayed 
and you can edit any of the active-link table's properties.</p>
<h2>Refreshing an Active-Link Table</h2>
<p>When you are working with a Form or Browse layout that is based on an 
active-link table, the Refresh command (F5 key) will refresh the data in the 
current row. So for example, if you are on a row in which the company name shows 
'Microsoft Corporation', and another user changes the data in the server table 
to 'Alpha Software', then when you press the F5 key, the data shown in the 
company field will change to 'Alpha Software', but data that was changed in 
other rows (that do not have focus) will not be updated in your Form or Browse 
layout.</p>
<p>You should note that in any row, as soon as you start typing to edit a value 
in a field, Alpha Five automatically does a Refresh on that row to ensure that 
you are editing the current data, not the data that was current at the time the 
active-link table was first opened.</p>
<p>You can also force Alpha Five to refresh all of the data in the active-link, 
not just the current row, by using the Refresh All Rows command. This command is 
on the 'Browse' menu (when you are using a Browse layout), or the 'Form' menu 
(when you are using a Form layout). You can use Shift+F5 as a shortcut for this 
command.</p>
<p>When you open an active-link table, Alpha Five executes the 'count' query in 
the active-link table definition to get a count of the number of records that 
satisfy the query for the active-link table. This means that any records that 
are added to the server-side table after the active-link table has been opened, 
are not visible in the active-link table. If you close, then re-open the 
active-link table, then those records would be visible. Alternatively, after the 
active-link table has been opened, the Refresh All Rows command can be used to 
refresh the active-link table (making newly added records visible) without having to close and re-open 
the active-link table.</p>
<p>The Xbasic command to refresh all rows is: <layout>.ServerSideRefreshAll()</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Refreshing Data in an Embedded Browse</h3>
<p>A common design pattern in many applications is to have a form that is based 
on a set with a one-to-many link (a so called 'master-detail' form). </p>
<p>The form will typically have a browse on it to display data from the 'many' 
side of the set. For example, in an invoice form, an embedded browse will will 
used to display the line-items for a given invoice header.</p>
<p>It is also quite common for the designer to make the embedded browse read 
only. The user will typically use a pop-up form to enter new line-item records, 
or edit existing line-item records. When the user closes the pop-up form, it is 
necessary to refresh the data in the embedded browse so that it reflects any 
edits or additions made by the user. The <browse>.ServerSideRefreshAll() method 
can be used to accomplish this.</p>
<p>The following Xbasic shows an example.</p>
<p>These assumptions are made:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The name of the embedded browse object on the form is 'browse1'.</li>
	<li>The primary key of the table shown in the embedded browse is 'id'.</li>
	<li>The name of the 'pop-up' form is 'InvoiceItems'.</li>
	<li>The embedded browse has an onDoubleClick event which will open the 
	pop-up form to edit the current record.</li>
</ul>
<p class="xbasic">dim p as p </p>
<p class="xbasic">dim currentId as c </p>
<p class="xbasic">dim tbl as p </p>
<p class="xbasic">'get a pointer to the table that the embedded browse is based 
on.</p>
<p class="xbasic">tbl = browse1.table_get()</p>
<p class="xbasic">'read the value of the Id field from the current row</p>
<p class="xbasic">currentID = tbl.Id</p>
<p class="xbasic">'open the form as Modal form. The script will pause while the 
form is open and the user is making his edits.</p>
<p class="xbasic">p = form.viewQueried("InvoiceItems","Id = " + 
s_quote(currentID), "", "Dialog")</p>
<p class="xbasic">'close the form. The script will resume execution.</p>
<p class="xbasic">p.close()</p>
<p class="xbasic">'refresh the embedded browse.</p>
<p class="xbasic">Browse1.ServerSideRefreshAll()</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Refreshing Active-Link Table Definitions</h2>
<p>You can refresh an active-link table definition by right clicking on it in the Control 
Panel and selecting Active Link Table, Refresh Definitions from the menu.</p>
<p>Alpha Five gives you the option of refreshing the current table, or as many 
of the other active-link tables in your database as you want.</p>
<table border="0" id="table44">
	<tr>
		<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
		<p class="ImageCaption"><img border="0" src="images/newina26.jpg"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
		<p class="ImageCaption">Refreshing Active-Link Table Definitions</td>
	</tr>
</table>
						<p>When you refresh the definition of an Active-Link 
						table all of the auto-generated SQL statements are 
						regenerated. If you change the structure of a remote 
						table, and you add new columns to the table, the 
						active-link table will NOT automatically display these 
						new columns unless the active-link definition is first 
						refreshed. </p>
<p>Of course, if you specified a custom SQL SELECT for the active-link table, 
you will need to manually edit your SELECT statement to include these new 
columns.</p>
<h2>Duplicating an Active-Link Table</h2>
<p>When you right-click on an active-link table in the Control Panel and select 
the Duplicate command, a new dialog is show that allows you to specify if you 
want the duplicated table to be another active-link table, or a native Alpha 
Five table. If you choose the native table option, then the standard 'Duplicate 
Table' dialog is shown. </p>
<p>Note that when you duplicate an active-link table to a native table, the 
resulting table will not have any records in it. It just has the structure of 
the active-link table, and also the dictionary of the active-link table. Because 
it has the active-link table's dictionary, all of the forms, reports, labels, 
etc that were defined for the active-link table are copied to the duplicated 
table.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Creating an Active-Link Definition using Xbasic</h2>
<p>You can create a simple read-only active link definition on the fly using 
Xbasic. The a5_Active_Link_CreateReadOnly() function allows you to create 
ad-hoc, read-only active link tables.</p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>L <i>flag</i> =&nbsp; a5_Active_Link_CreateReadOnly(C <i>table_filename</i> 
,C <i>connectionString</i> ,C <i>selectStatement</i> [,L <i>
flagAddTableToDatabse</i> ])</p>
<p>Where</p>
<table style="BORDER-COLLAPSE: collapse" cellSpacing="1" cellPadding="3" border="1" id="table45">
<tr>

<p>Example:</p>
<p>The following code creates an an active-link table using a saved connection 
string to the sample Northwind database. The active-link table has just two 
columns, customerId and ContactName. A default browse is then opened to show the 
data in the active-link table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">a5_Active_Link_CreateReadOnly("c:\mydata\temptable.dbf","::name::northwind","select customerid, 
contactname from customers",.f.)</p>
<p class="xbasic">a5_open_default_browse("c:\mydata\temptable.dbf")</p>

<h2>Understanding Local and Server-Side Queries</h2>
<p>When you query an active-link table, you can either perform the query 
locally, or on the server. If you are working with an active-link table that is 
connected to a table with a few records, then it will probably make little 
difference if you use local queries, or server-side queries. But if your 
active-link table is connected to a server table that has a large number of 
records, then running queries on the server will be dramatically faster. This is 
because when you run a local query, Alpha Five has to first retrieve all of the 
data from the server before the query is actually run. With a server-side query, 
the query is performed on the server, and only the results of the query are 
retrieved.</p>
<p>If an active-link table is based on a stored procedure, rather than a SQL 
Select statement, then it is not possible to do further server-side queries 
after the active-link table has been opened. In this case, you must use local 
queries.</p>
<p>When you are working with a form or a browse layout that is based on an 
active-link table the following new method can be used to perform 
server-side queries:</p>
<ul>
<li><Layout>.ServerSideQueryRun()</li>
<li><Layout>.ServerSideQueryRetract()</li>
<li><Layout>.ServerSideQuery_Show_All()</li>
<li><Layout>.ServerSideRefreshAll()</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, assume that the form 'Customers' is based on an active-link 
table. The following Interactive window session shows how both local and 
server-side queries can be performed:</p>
<p class="xbasic">dim p as p </p>
<p class="xbasic">p = form.view("customers")</p>
<p class="xbasic">'perform a local query&nbsp; </p>
<p class="xbasic">'notice that Xbasic syntax is used for the local query - 
strings are double quoted and the or operator is .OR.</p>
<p class="xbasic">p.QueryRun("city = \"London\" .or. city = \"Paris\"","lastname+firstname")</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'turn off the local filter</p>
<p class="xbasic">p.Show_All()</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'now do the same filter on the server</p>
<p class="xbasic">'notice that SQL syntax is used for the filter - strings are 
single quoted and the or operator is OR (not .OR.)</p>
<p class="xbasic">'also notice that the order parameter is a comma delimited 
list, not an expression</p>
<p class="xbasic">p.ServerSideQueryRun("city = 'London' OR city = 'Paris'","lastname, 
firstname")</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'turn off the server-side filter</p>
<p class="xbasic">p.ServerSideQuery_Show_All()</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When working with an active-link table using Xbasic, the following new table 
methods are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><tbl>.ServerSideQueryRun()</li>
<li><tbl>.ServerSideQueryRetract()</li>
<li><tbl>.ServerSideQueryRetractAll()</li>
<li><tbl>.ServerSide_Records_Get()</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, assume that 'mysql_customers' is an active-link table that is 
bound to the 'customers' table in a MySQL database. The following Interactive 
window session shows how you can use Xbasic to perform local and server-side 
queries on this active-link table:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">dim tbl as p </p>
<p class="xbasic">tbl = table.open("mysql_customers")</p>
<p class="xbasic">?tbl.records_get()</p>
<p class="xbasic">= 56,023</p>
<p class="xbasic">dim i as p </p>
<p class="xbasic">'Run a local query</p>
<p class="xbasic">i = tbl.Query_Create("","city = \"Boston\"","Lastname")</p>
<p class="xbasic">?i.records_get()</p>
<p class="xbasic">= 456</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'Run a server-side query</p>
<p class="xbasic">? tbl.ServerSideQueryRun("city = 'Boston'")</p>
<p class="xbasic">= 456</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'Now search for lastname = 'Smith' within the found set of 
Boston records</p>
<p class="xbasic">'To search within the found set, the additive flag is set to 
.t.</p>
<p class="xbasic">? tbl.ServerSideQueryRun("lastname = 'Smith'","",.t.)</p>
<p class="xbasic">= 23</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'Now retract the last filter</p>
<p class="xbasic">? tbl.ServerSideQueryRetract()</p>
<p class="xbasic">= .t.</p>
<p class="xbasic">?tbl.records_get()</p>
<p class="xbasic">= 456</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Query Optimizer</h2>
<p>When you run a query on an active-link table using the standard Xbasic <tbl>.query_create() 
method, the Query Optimizer will analyze the filter and order expression to 
determine if the filter, or&nbsp; part of the filter, can be executed on the 
server, and if the sorting can be done on the server. Any portion of the query 
that can be performed on the server will be executed on the server and the 
remaining part of the query (if any) will be run locally (i.e. client-side).</p>
<p>If you prefer to run the query locally, you can bypass the Query Optimizer 
and force the query to be a local query by specifying the "L" query flag. </p>
<p>The "S" query flag turns on the Query Optimizer. By default this flag is 
assumed for queries on active-link tables.</p>
<p>Note: <tbl>.query_create() is for use where the filter and order expressions 
are defined using Xbasic syntax. If you want to use SQL syntax for the filter 
and order expression, then you can use the <tbl>.ServerSideQueryRun() method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How the Query Optimizer Analyzes Xbasic Filter/Order Expressions</h3>
<p>The Query Optimizer uses these table methods to determine which part of a 
filter can be executed on the server and which part must be executed locally and 
whether the sorting can be done on the server:</p>
<p><tbl>.to_sql_filter(C <i>filterExpression</i>, c <i>separator</i>)</p>
<p><tbl>.to_sql_order(C <i>orderExpression</i>, c <i>separator</i>)</p>
<p><tbl>.to_sql_expression(C <i>expression</i>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, say you have an active-link table called 'customer'. The remote 
SQL table has a field called 'CityName'. In the active-link table definition, 
this field name was mapped to 'City'.</p>
<p>Here is an Interactive window session demonstrating these methods:</p>
<p class="xbasic">t = table.open("customer")</p>
<p class="xbasic">?t.to_sql_filter("(city = \"london\" .or. city = \"madrid\" ).and. foobar(city=\"london\") 
","|")<br>
= (CityName='london' or CityName="madrid")|foobar(city="london")<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The function returns the client-side portion and the server side portion 
separated by the separator. A pipe in this case. </p>
<p>The server-side portion of the filter is:</p>
<p class="xbasic">(CityName='london' or CityName="madrid")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that Alpha Five has translated the '.or.' operator (Xbasic syntax) to 
'or' (SQL syntax). It has translated the active-link table fieldname 'City' to 
the corresponding field name in the remote table ('CityName'). It has changed 
the double quotes on the literal values to single quotes.</p>
<p>The client-side portion of the filter is:</p>
<p class="xbasic">foobar(city="london")</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foobar() is a UDF that the user wrote using Xbasic and there is no equivalent 
server-side function, so this part of the filter must be performed locally.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><Tbl>.query_create() and <tbl>.query_run() Methods</h2>
<p>These two methods of a table object now support an additional flag in the 
case where the table is an active-link table. If "S" is included in the list of 
flags passed in, the query (or a portion of the query) will be run on the server 
if possible. For example, say that you had an active-link table called 
'customers'.</p>
<p class="xbasic">t = table.open("customers")</p>
<p class="xbasic">indx = t.query_create("S","Lastname = 'smith'","Lastname")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, Alpha Five will be able to translate the entire filter 
expression to SQL and will perform the query on the server.</p>
<p>Now consider the case where the filter expression uses a locally defined UDF:</p>
<p class="xbasic">t = table.open("customers")</p>
<p class="xbasic">indx = t.query_create("S","myfunction(Lastname) = 'smith'","Lastname")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, the filter expression cannot be converted to SQL, and the query 
will be performed on the client (i.e. by Alpha Five).</p>
<p>In some cases, the filter expression can be decomposed into a part that can 
be done on the server and another part that must be done on the client. In that 
case, Alpha Five will perform the query on the server first to limit the number 
of records that must be queried on the client.</p>
<p>The following example contains a filter that can be decomposed in a 
server-side portion, and a client-side portion:</p>
<p class="xbasic">t = table.open("customers")</p>
<p class="xbasic">indx = t.query_create("S","state = 'ma' .and. 
myfunction(Lastname) = 'smith'","Lastname")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "state= 'ma' " part of the filter can be performed on the server, and the 
"myfunction(lastname)" part of the filter will be performed on the client (i.e. 
by Alpha Five).</p>

<h2>Querying Active-Link Tables from the User Interface</h2>
<p>When you are working with a Form or Browse layout that is based on an 
active-link table (or a set in which the set's primary table is an 
active-link table), and you select a command that does a query (such as the 
Query Genie, Sort, Find by Key, Quick Filter, etc.), you can either do this 
query on the client side, or on the server side. If the active-link table is 
bound to a server table with a few records, then it does not make much 
difference where the query is executed. But if the active-link table is 
bound to a server table with millions of records, then it will make a huge 
difference.</p>
<p>When you select any type of query command, Alpha Five will display a 
dialog asking you where the query should be executed, as shown below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/What's17.jpg"></p>
<p>The dialog allows you to specify a choice, and it also allows you to 
specify that in the future, the dialog should be suppressed.</p>
<p>When you check the 'Don't show this dialog in the future' box, some 
additional choices are shown:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/What's5.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;You can specify that the query should always be server-side, 
client-side, or automatic, in which case Alpha Five will make the decision 
based on the number of records in the server table. If you choose the option 
to not show the dialog again, you can select the Query, Preferences command 
from the menus to display this dialog:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/What's16.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your own application, you might want to deny your users the 
choice. The active-link table definition allows you to specify where 
queries should be run and whether users can have access to the Query, 
Preferences command to override you setting. Obviously, if you know that a 
particular active-link table will be bound to a server table with a large 
number of records, you will want to configure the active-link table 
definition to use server-side queries and not to allow the user to override 
this setting.</p>
<h2>Query Genie for Server-side Queries</h2>
<p>When you select the Query Genie command to execute a server-side query, 
the following dialog is displayed. The genie allows you to define a filter 
and and order that will be applied to the active-link table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0" id="table32">
<tr>
<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
<p>
	<img src="images/What's20.jpg" alt="Image" />
</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
<p class="ImageCaption">The Server-side Query Genie (Configured to show 
the Preview as as Tab Pane and not to show the SQL)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Query Genie's appearance can be configured. If you have a larger 
monitor, you might want to put the Preview window directly on on the main 
Query Genie window so that you don't have to go to a different tab pane in 
order to see the query preview. Also, if you are comfortable writing SQL 
WHERE clauses by hand, you might want to show the WHERE clause directly on 
the dialog. To configure the layout of the Query Genie, click the 
Preferences icon (leftmost icon) on the toolbar at the bottom of the genie. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0" id="table34">
<tr>
<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
<p class="ImageCaption"><img border="0" src="images/What's18.jpg"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
<p class="ImageCaption">Customizing the Server-side Query Genie Layout</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0" id="table33">
<tr>
<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
<p class="ImageCaption"><img border="0" src="images/What's19.jpg" width="75%" height="75%"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
<p class="ImageCaption">The Server-side Query Genie (configured to show 
the Preview window directly on the dialog, and to show the Filter 
Expression generated by the Genie)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Two-way Editing of Filter Expressions</h3>
<p>The Server-side Query Genie supports two-way editing. You can either 
define the filter by making selections in the top part of the dialog (i.e. 
using the builder), or you can type the filter directly into the 'Filter 
Expression' textbox. When you manually edit the expression shown in the 
'Filter Expression' textbox, the 'Parse filter expression' hyperlink button 
becomes enabled and clicking on it causes Alpha Five to parse the expression 
you entered and to fill in the builder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

video demonstration of this feature</a></p>
<h2>Find by Key for Server-side Queries</h2>
<p>When you are working with native Alpha Five tables, the 'Find by Key' 
feature in Alpha Five is used to quickly position the record pointer at the 
closest matching record. For example, say you have a table with 100,000 
records that is sorted by Lastname. If you execute a 'Find by Key' command, 
searching for 'Smi', Alpha Five will position the record pointer on the 
record with the lastname that is closest to 'Smi' (e.g. 'Smith'). Alpha Five 
does not filter the table. After you execute the command you still have 
100,000 records in your active query. </p>
<p>There is no server-side analogy for find by key, so when you execute a 
find by key command against an active link table, Alpha Five does a query 
looking for all records greater than, or equal to, the key value that you 
entered. So, in the above example, Alpha Five would execute a server-side 
query for left(lastname,3) >= 'smi'. </p>
<br>
<h2>Understanding Record Locking in Active-Link Tables</h2>
<p>When you are working with local Alpha Five tables, Alpha Five uses a 
record locking scheme called 'pessimistic record locking'. This means that 
when a user starts to edit a record, a lock is placed on that record and no 
other user can edit the record until the user releases the lock on the 
record (by either saving the record, or canceling changes). When working 
with active-link tables a different approach, called 'optimistic record 
locking' is employed. It is not desirable to lock records on the server (as 
it might result in performance degradation on the server). Instead, when a 
record is saved on the server Alpha Five can check to see if any other user 
has edited the record in the interval between starting to make changes, and 
then actually saving those changes. If the record has been changed in this 
interval, then the update will fail (so as to avoid overwriting any changes 
that were made by the other user). Whether Alpha Five checks for changes to 
the record before committing changes to the server database or not is 
actually configurable. See the section below on the Active-Link Table 
Definition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following Interactive window session demonstrates these issues 
(assume that 'access_customers' is an active-link table on the 'customers' 
table in the sample 'Northwind' database): </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic"><br>
t1 = table.open("access_customers")<br>
?t1.CONTACTNAME<br>
= "Maria Anders "<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'open another instance o<br>
t2 = table.open("access_customers")<br>
?t2.CONTACTNAME<br>

&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'Change the value in the 'contactname' fields<br>
t1.change_begin()<br>
t1.CONTACTNAME = "Marla Stein"<br>
t1.change_end(.t.)<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'In the second open instance of the table, check the value 
of the 'contactname' field.</p>
<p class="xbasic">'Note that it still has its original value<br>
?t2.CONTACTNAME<br>
= "Maria Anders "<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'Put the second instance into change mode and then check 
the value of the 'contactname' field<br>
t2.change_begin()<br>
?t2.CONTACTNAME<br>
= "Marla Stein"</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'Note that 'contactname' now has the up-to-date value for 
this field.</p>
<p class="xbasic">'I.e. As soon as the record was put into change mode,

&nbsp;</p>

<p class="xbasic">'Note that it is still 'Marla Stein' because its contents

<p class="xbasic">'However, after we put the record into change mode, its 
value is refreshed<br>

t1.change_end(.t.)<br>
?t1.CONTACTNAME<br>

&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">t2.change_begin()<br>

Refresh the data to see the current server values.</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above example shows that when working with an active-link table, it 
    is possible to get an error on the .change_end() method. It is less likely, 
    that you will get an error on the .change_begin() method. Contrast this with 
    a native Alpha Five table. In a native table, it is quite possible to get an 
    error on the .change_begin() method because Alpha Five might not be able to 
    get a lock on the record you want to edit. However, if the .change_begin() 
    succeeds, then the .change_end() will not fail because of a record locking 
    issue (there may be other reasons why .change_end() will fail, and of 
    course, your Xbasic code should allow for this possibility).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how you could include error checking in a Xbasic script:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">dim t as p </p>
<p class="xbasic">t = table.open("customer")</p>
<p class="xbasic">while .not. t.fetch_eof()</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on error goto couldNotLockRecord</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t.change_begin()</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on error goto 0</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t.salary = t.salary * 1.1</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on error goto couldNotSaveRecord</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t.change_end(.t.)</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fetchNext:</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t.fetch_next()</p>
<p class="xbasic">end while</p>
<p class="xbasic">end</p>
<p class="xbasic">couldNotLockRecord:</p>
<p class="xbasic">ui_msg_box("Error","Could not edit record number " + 
    t.recno() + ". Failed to get lock on record."</p>
<p class="xbasic">goto fetchNext </p>
<p class="xbasic">end </p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">couldNotSaveRecord: </p>
<p class="xbasic">ui_msg_box("Error","Could not save record number " + 
    t.recno() + " after making edits."</p>
<p class="xbasic">goto fetchNext</p>
<p class="xbasic">end</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Optimistic Record Locking in Forms and Browse Layouts</h2>
<p>When you are editing a data in a Form or Browse layout that is based on an 
active-link table, and an optimistic lock error occurs, Alpha Five displays 
dialog boxes that give you options as to how you want to handle the error. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table border="0" id="table46">
	<tr>
		<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
		<p class="ImageCaption"><img border="0" src="images/NewInA62.jpg"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
		<p class="ImageCaption">Write Conflict Warning.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you click the 'Abandon Changes' button then any changes you made to the 
record are lost, and the record in the Browse or Form layout is updated to show 
the current values on the server (which will reflect the changes made by the 
other user). Before you abandon your changes however, you might want to click 
the 'Copy changes to the clipboard' hyperlink so that you have a record of the 
changes that you were attempting to make.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can click the 'Examine Conflicts' button, which brings up 
a dialog similar to this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table border="0" id="table47">
	<tr>
		<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
		<p class="ImageCaption"><img border="0" src="images/NewInA63.jpg" width="75%" height="75%"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top">
		<p class="ImageCaption">Examine Conflicts dialog box.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This dialog allows you to selectively overwrite the changes made by the other 
user. For example in the image shown above you can see that when you first began 
editing the record the value in the 'Contactname' field was 'Maria Larsson' and 
the value in the 'Contacttitlle' was 'owner'.</p>
<p>After you began editing this record, but <b>before</b>, you saved any 
changes, another user changed the 'Contacttitle' field to 'Sales Manager' (shown 
in red in the 'Saved Value' column).</p>
<p>You then changed 'Contactname' to 'Maria Anderson', and 'Contacttitle' to 
'Manager' (shown in blue in the 'Edited Value' column).</p>
<p>If you press the 'Save record (and overwrite other user's edits)' button, the 
values with the red exclamation mark icon in the 'Value to be Saved' column, 
will overwrite the other user's edits.</p>
<p>By making a selection in the dropdown box in the 'Save' column, you can 
selectively specify which of the edits you have made should overwrite edits made 
by the other user.</p>
<p>If you set the dropdown box to 'Saved' then you will not overwrite any data 
in this field. If you set the dropdown box to 'Initial' then you will reset the 
data in this field to its initial value (before you made any edits). If you set 
the dropdown box to 'Edited' then the edits you made to the record will be 
saved. You will notice that if you set the dropdown box to 'Saved' the 
exclamation mark icon next to the field is removed because this option does not 
overwrite edits made by the other user.</p>

<h2>Prompting for Username and/or Password when Opening an Active-Link Table</h2>
<p>When you define an active-link table, you can specify if Alpha Five should 
store the username and password to connect to the remote database in the 
active-link definition, or whether it should prompt for a password only, or user 
name and password.</p>
<p>If you specify that Alpha Five should prompt for a user name and/or password, 
you can suppress the prompt by supplying these values in the optional argument 
object that you can pass into the table.open() method.</p>
<p>In the example below, assume that 'customers' is an active-link table and 
that the connection string for link has a username of 'alpha' and a password of 
'70blanchard'.</p>
<p>Assume also, that the active-link definition specifies that Alpha Five will 
prompt for user name and password.</p>
<p>If you execute this command in the Interactive window, a dialog will appear 
asking for the user name and password:</p>
<p class="xbasic">t = table.open("customers")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, if you create and argument object and specify the user name and then 
again try to open the table, you will get prompt for the password (but not the 
user name). That's because the user name was passed in in the arguments object:</p><a name="Active-Link Table Definition">
<p class="xbasic">dim args as sql::arguments<br>
args.add("username","alpha")<br>
t = table.open("customers",args)<br>
&nbsp;</p></a>
<p>Finally, if you pass in both the user name and the password in the arguments 
object, Alpha Five does not display any dialog box before opening the table:</p>
<p class="xbasic">dim args as sql::arguments<br>
args.add("username","alpha")</p></a>
<p class="xbasic">args.add("password","70blanchard")<br>
t = table.open("customers",args)<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Oracle Sequences</h2>
<p>Oracle uses 'sequences' to implement auto-increment fields. This
<a href="http://support.alphasoftware.com/WhatsNewInV9/Oracle%20Database%20Sequences%20and%20Alpha%20Five.pdf">white paper</a> 
discusses the use of Oracle sequences in the Alpha Five context.</p>
<h2>Active-Link Tables on MySQL Databases</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, MySQL is extremely slow at executing COUNT queries against 
large tables in situations where there is no WHERE clause to limit the number of 
records to be counted. As a result of this limitation in MySQL, if you create an 
active-link table definition on a large MySQL table, and you do not put a WHERE 
clause in the active-link definition SELECT statement, the active-link table 
would be slow to open.</p>
<p>This is because when an active-link table is first opened, Alpha Five 
executes a COUNT query to determine how many records will be in the active-link 
table.</p>
<p>Active-link table definitions include a 'FetchLimit' property. This property 
is only honored when connecting to a MySQL database.&nbsp; The 'FetchLimit' 
property specifies the maximum number of records to fetch from the server if the 
SELECT statement has no WHERE clause. The default value for this property is 
1,000. If the FetchLimit is set to 0, then there is no FetchLimit. </p>
<p>When you are browsing the data in the active-link table and you reach the 
FetchLimit, Alpha Five will display a dialog telling you that you have reached 
the FetchLimit and asking you to specify a new FetchLimit.</p>
<p>There is really no 'down-side' to this new property because it is not 
limiting the number of records that can be shown in active-link table. It is 
merely limiting the number of records that are initially shown when an 
active-link table with no WHERE clause is opened. </p>
<p>In typical usage, a user will open a form or browse that is based on an 
active-link table, and then start searching for specific records. The form or 
browse will open quickly, and then once the user starts executing server-side 
queries, the FetchLimit will be removed because the active-link table will now 
have a WHERE clause. </p>
<p>When you open a form or browse on an active-link table that is linked to a 
large MySQL table, if the active-link definition does not have a WHERE clause, 
and if the number of records in the active-link table is equal to or greater 
than the FetchLimit, the status bar, which normally shows the record count, will 
show '<Unknown>'. Then, when you do a search for a specific set of records, the 
status bar will then show the actual record count of the number of records that 
satisfy the query.</p>
<h2>Active-Link Tables - Entering New Records</h2>
<p>When you are using a 
Browse to display data from a table, and you click the 'Enter new Record' icon 
on the toolbar, Alpha Five gives focus to the 'new record row' in the Browse and 
fills in the rows above the 'new record row' with data from the records at the 
logical end of the table (based on the current sort order). For example, assume 
you are Browsing a table with 100,000 records, and your Browse shows 20 records. 
If you enter a new record, Alpha Five will show logical record number 999,981 to 
100,000 followed by the 'new record row'.</p>
<p>In the case of native tables, regardless of the size of the table, Alpha Five 
can fetch the records from the end of the table very quickly, and so moving to 
the 'new record row' is immediate. However, in the case of active-link tables, 
fetching records from the end of the table can be slow if there are a lot of 
records in the table. This is because Alpha Five must retrieve all of the 
records from the server. </p>
<p>Because fetching all of the records from the server is potentially slow, when 
a Browse is based on an active-link table, Alpha Five uses the following rules 
to optimize performance:</p>
<ul style="font-family: Tahoma; width: 7in; font-size: 9pt; margin-left: .5in; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px">
	<li style="font-family: Tahoma; width: 7in; font-size: 9pt; margin-left: .5in; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px">If all of the records in the active-link table have already been fetched, 
	then when the user clicks the 'New Record' icon, Alpha Five will display the 
	'New Record' row and back fill the browse with data from the end of the 
	table (same as behavior for native tables).</li>
	<li style="font-family: Tahoma; width: 7in; font-size: 9pt; margin-left: .5in; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px">
	If all of the records in the active-link table have not been fetched, and 
	Alpha Five needs to fetch 5,000 or fewer records to get to the end of the 
	table, then when the user clicks the 'New Record' icon, Alpha Five will 
	display the 'New Record' row and back fill the browse with data from the end 
	of the table (same as behavior for native tables).</li>
	<li style="font-family: Tahoma; width: 7in; font-size: 9pt; margin-left: .5in; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px">
	If Alpha Five would need to fetch more than 5,000 records to get to the end 
	of the table, or if the active-link table has an unknown record count (only 
	possible in the case of MySQL), then Alpha Five will show the 'New Record' 
	row as the only row in the Browse. Since no data has to be fetched for the 
	server in this case, moving to the 'New Record' row will be quick.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tracing SQL</h2>
<p>When working with active-link tables, it can sometimes be useful to see what 
SQL is actually getting sent to the server when you edit the data in an an 
active-link table. You can turn on SQL tracing when you define your connection 
string. The connection string dialog has a 'Trace SQL' checkbox. When you check 
this box, all SQL statements that are sent to the server are also echoed to the 
SQL pane in the Trace window. You can open the Trace window by selecting View, 
Trace Window from the menus.</p>
<p>Tip: If you base your active-link table definitions on named connection 
strings (rather than explicit connection strings), then it will be easy to turn 
on and off SQL tracing for all of your active-link tables because you can just 
go to one place to modify the connection strings for all of your active-link 
tables.</p>

<h2>Methods for Active-Link Tables<br></h2>
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><Layout>.ServerSideQueryRun() Method</b> - Applies an incremental 
filter to an active-link table. The query is executed on the server. Contrast 
with <Layout>.QueryRun(), which applies an incremental filter by running a local 
query.</p>
<p>Syntax: N <i>RecordsFound</i> =&nbsp; <Layout>.ServerSideQueryRun(C <i>filter</i> ,C 
<i>order</i> [,L <i>additive</i> ])</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
Where:<div>
<table id="table30" style="BORDER-COLLAPSE: collapse" cellSpacing="1" cellPadding="3" border="1">
<tr>
<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top" >
<i>RecordsFound </i></td>
<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top" >
Returns the number of records found by the query. If the layout 
is not based on an active-link table, returns -1. The the layout 
is based on an active-link table that does not allow incremental 
server-side querying, returns -2. For example, an active-link 
table that was based on a stored procedure would not allow 
incremental server-side querying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top" >
<i>filter </i></td>
<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top" >
The filter expression. The filter expression must use portable 
SQL syntax. The filter is in addition to any filter that was 
defined when the active-link table was defined. For example if 
the SELECT statement for the active-link table was SELECT * FROM 
customers WHERE state = 'MA', then the active-link table will 
always have a base filter of state = 'MA'. I.e. any filter that 
is specified is in addition to the base filter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top" >
<i>order</i></td>
<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top" >
The order expression. The order expression must use portable SQL 
syntax.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top" >
<i>additive</i></td>
<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top" >
Specifies if the <i>filter</i> should be in addition to any 
previous filters applied using the .ServerSideQueryRun() method. </td>
</tr>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following Interactive Window session shows how the .ServerSideQueryRun() 
method can be used:</p>
<p class="xbasic">'assume that the 'customers' browse is based on an active-link 
table</p>
<p class="xbasic">p = Browse.Open("customers")</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'sort data by city, without changing the filter</p>
<p class="xbasic">? p.ServerSideQueryRun("","City",.t.) </p>
<p class="xbasic">= 1000</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'sort by lastname for city = 'London'</p>
<p class="xbasic">?p.ServerSideQueryRun("city='London'","lastname",.f.)</p>
<p class="xbasic">= 20</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'search for title = 'manager' (additive)</p>
<p class="xbasic">'because additive is specified, the full filter is city = 
'London' and title = 'manager'</p>
<p class="xbasic">'since the previous query was city = 'London'</p>
<p class="xbasic">?p.ServerSideQueryRun("title = 'manager'","",.t.)</p>
<p class="xbasic">= 5</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">'search for title = 'manager' (not additive)</p>
<p class="xbasic">'since the query is not additive, the full filter is title = 
'manager' (i.e. previous queries are ignored)</p>
<p class="xbasic">?p.ServerSideQueryRun("title = 'manager'","",.f.)</p>
<p class="xbasic">= 345</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><Layout>.ServerSideQueryRetract() Method</b> - Removes the 
previously applied server-side incremental filter to the primary table of a 
browse or form layout (assuming that the primary table is an active-link table).&nbsp; 
The server-side query is applied using the <Layout>.ServerSideQueryRun() method. 
This method has an <i>additive</i> parameter. If the .ServerSideQueryRun() 
method is called with <i>additive</i> set to .t. then the queries are added to a 
stack. The .ServerSideQueryRetract() method removes the last query from the 
stack. To remove all queries from the stack, see the .ServerSideQuery_Show_All() 
method.</p>
<p>Syntax: L <i>Result</i> = <Layout>.ServerSideQueryRetract()</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><Layout>.ServerSideQuery_Show_All() Method</b> - Removes all of the 
previously applied server-side incremental filters to the primary table of a 
browse or form layout (assuming that the primary table is an active-link table).&nbsp; 
To retract just the last applied incremental server-side filter, use the .ServerSideQueryRetract() 
method.</p>
<p>Syntax: L <i>Result</i> = <Layout>.ServerSideQuery_Show_All()</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><tbl>.ServerSideQueryRun() Method</b> - Applies an incremental filter to 
an active-link table. The query is executed on the server. Contrast with <tbl>.Query_Create() 
which runs a local query.</p>
<p>Syntax: N <i>RecordsFound</i> =&nbsp; <Tbl>.ServerSideQueryRun(C <i>filter</i> ,C

<td style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: top" >
Returns the number of records found by the query. If the table 
is not an active-link table, returns -1. The the active-link table does not allow incremental 
server-side querying, returns -2. For example, an active-link

the <tbl>.Records_Get() method because <tbl>.Records_Get() will cause the local 
record cache to be fully populated ( i.e. every row in the active-link table 
will be retrieved). Takes an optional <i>forceTrueCountIfLimitOn</i> flag.</p>

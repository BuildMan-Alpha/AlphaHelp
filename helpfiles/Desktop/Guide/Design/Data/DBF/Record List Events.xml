	<description>You can trap an event when the user clicks on the column heading of a column in a record list.
For example, the following script traps events for the record list control. By including the directive:
</description>
<sections>
<section>
	<example><![CDATA[!rl_*]]></example>
	
</section>	
<section>
	<description>in the definition of the record list, you instruct Alpha Anywhere to generate all events for the record list. When you click on the first column heading, a_dlg_button will be set to rl_column1, etc. (The " rl_ " prefix is defined by the " !rl_* " directive).
This script prints the name of the event to the Trace window.

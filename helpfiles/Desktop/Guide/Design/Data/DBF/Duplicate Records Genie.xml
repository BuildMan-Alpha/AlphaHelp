	<description>Alpha Anywhere adds another powerful productivity tool in the Delete Duplicate Records Genie. The Delete Duplicate Records Genie helps you find, review, and optionally mark or delete duplicate records.
Alpha Anywhere has always had a facility to mark and delete duplicate records. Typically, users would use the Mark Duplicate Records operation to mark all duplicate records. Then they would manually preview the marked records to decide which marked records were indeed duplicates. Finally, they would delete the marked duplicates. This new genie makes it much easier to go through these steps because it allows you to easily compare the original record (the master record) with each of the duplicates of that record. as you compare the master record with its duplicates you can decide if you want to retain any record marked for deletion.</description>

<title>Using Xbasic to Remove Duplicates</title>		
<description>Finally, you can also display the Delete Duplicate Records Genie using an Xbasic method:
</description>		
<example><![CDATA[a5_viewduprecs(tablename as C, duplicate_key_expression as C, run_query_to_find_dups as L )
]]></example>		
		
	</section>
<section>

<description>For example:
</description>		
<example><![CDATA[dim tbl as T
tbl = table.open("customer")
tbl.mark_range("state",".t.") 'mark all duplicate states
tbl.close()
'open the genie - no need to run the query to mark duplicate states because it has already been run.
A5_viewduprecs("customer", "state", .f.)]]></example>		
		
	</section>	
	<section>

<description>Alternatively, open the genie and run a query to mark duplicate states before displaying any data in the genie:
</description>		
<example><![CDATA[A5_viewduprecs("customer","state",.t.)]]></example>

	<description>Packing a table removes deleted records from the database and compresses memo fields. You should pack tables periodically so that they take up less space and to help database operations run more quickly. 
 After packing a table, you can no longer undelete records. Also, if you select Compact Database before Backup in the Backup dialog box, Alpha Anywhere packs the records and you cannot undelete them.</description>

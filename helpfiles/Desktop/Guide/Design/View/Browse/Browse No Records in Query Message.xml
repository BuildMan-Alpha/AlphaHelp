	<topic>Browse - No Records in Query Message
</topic>
<description>If you have a Browse layout open and you execute some Xbasic that sets the Browse filter to a query that does not find any matching records, then if the Browse allows data entry, focus will move to the new record row. However, if the Browse does not allow data entry, the Browse did not have any facility for presenting a message to the user. Now, the Browse has a new property that allows you to set the 'No records in query' message. The message can either be plain text, or html.

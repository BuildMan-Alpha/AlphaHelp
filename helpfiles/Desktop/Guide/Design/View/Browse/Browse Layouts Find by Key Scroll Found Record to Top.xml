</topic>
<description>In V9 and earlier, when using the Find by Key dialog in a Browse, the record that was found was scrolled to the top of the browse. In V10, the record pointer was moved to the found record, but the record remained in its current scroll position.

	<description>This results in less screen painting when doing a Find by Key operation. However, some users did not like this new behavior so now when using the Find by Key dialog in a Browse, you will see a new option in the dialog that allows you to force Alpha Anywhere to scroll the found record to the top of the browse. This option setting is remembered so that when you open the Find by Key dialog on subsequent occasions, you do not need to remember to reset it to your preference.</description>

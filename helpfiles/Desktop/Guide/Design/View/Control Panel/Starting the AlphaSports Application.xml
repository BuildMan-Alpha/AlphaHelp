	<title>Main Menu OnInit Event</title>
<description>The OnInit event gives the developer the opportunity to configure the form (or application) environment before the user sees the first form or can execute any functions. In most cases the developer wants to present a seamless, self contained application, and this implies cutting off access to the Control Panel .</description>	
<note>The developer should always preserve some way to access the Control Panel, in case its tools are required to solve a problem.</note>	
</section>	
<section>
	<description>The OnInit event runs a single line of Xbasic code, which hides the Control Panel from the operator.

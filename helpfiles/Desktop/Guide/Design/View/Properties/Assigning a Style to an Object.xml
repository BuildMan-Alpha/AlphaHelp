</topic>
<description>Just like in a word processor, where you can assign a style to a paragraph (for example, Heading1, Heading2, Body) etc., Alpha Anywhere lets you define multiple styles for each object type. By right-clicking on an object, you can assign a style. </description>

	<description>For example, in the image below, the text object that is currently selected has a style of "Heading". Other text objects on this form have a style of "Field Label".

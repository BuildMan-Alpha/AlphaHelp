	<title>Pre-calculate Record Count
</title>
	<description>To prevent blank reports (where the filter criteria selected no records) from printing, select View Settings > Preferences > Reports > Pre-calculate Record Count. Set the Value field to "Yes". This will cause slower printing, particularly for longer reports, but it allows Alpha Anywhere to display a warning message when a report has a zero record count.

	<title>Warning Dialogs</title>
	<description>Select View Settings > Preferences > Reports > Warning Dialogs. Set the Value to "Yes" to show a warning dialog when printing a report and when the current selection of records is meaningless.

	<title>Printing from Preview Window
</title>
	<description>When the user prints from the Preview window, should the Preview window be automatically closed? Select View Settings > Preferences > Reports > Printing from Preview Window. Set the Value to "Yes" to automatically close the Preview window and maintain Alpha Four compatibility.

	<topic>Editing a Layout Table Report</topic>
	<description>Editing a Layout Table Report is somewhat different from editing a Free Form Report, although many operations, such as adding a field to the report, are the same for the two types of report. For general information about Free Form reports, see Report Topics.
When editing a Layout Table Report, however, you must think in terms of rows and columns and regions, as though you were working in a spreadsheet or HTML table â€” which, in fact, may be your ultimate targets for the report.

	<title>Selecting a rectangular region of cells
</title>
<description>There are two methods for selecting a rectangular region of cells: ruler shift-drag, and cell shift-click (a.k.a. Quick rectangle selection). The ruler shift-drag method depends on the convention that when you hold down the SHIFT key when you drag, the report editor will remember your previous selection on the other axis</description>

	<title>Ruler shift-drag rectangular region selection

	<title>Using box elements in Layout Table reports</title>
<description>Boxes are to layout table reports what ranges are to spreadsheets. While it is similar to a rectangular region, it is a persistent object in the report.
You can add a box via the layout table cell menu, which is accessed by clicking the down arrow on the top right corner of the selected cell. You can also add a box by clicking the box icon on the layout table toolbar.
By default, the Quick Report Genie creates one box for columnar layout table reports. If you create a report and click on the top left cell of the report , you will see a blue 'box-corner' icon.

<section>
	
<description>Click on this icon to show the box selection. From here you can change the size and location of the box. You resize the box by dragging the corners (note the green hash-marks at each corner - these are drag targets).
</description>	
<figure><link>images/box_element_selection.PNG</link></figure>	
</section>


<section>
	
<description>The box element has its own context menu, which is available when the box is selected - if you click on the arrow in the top-right corner of box, you will see a menu that presents the possible box formats, as well as the option to delete the box.
</description>

</section>


<section>

<description>Using formats allows the stylesheet to handle the appearance of the box on the report. If you want to make inline style modifications, you can do so using the border, fill, and/or font properties or toolbars while the box is selected.

	<title>Using the Layout Table toolbar
</title>
<description>You will notice on the report toolbar for layout table reports there is a new 'layout table' icon next to the text/border and formatting toolbar buttons.
</description>

<description>If you click this when the layout table toolbar is hidden, the layout table toolbar will display. The layout table toolbar is displayed by default when you open a layout table for editing.

<section>
	<title>Row Options
</title>
<description>The first section of this toolbar deals with row options. The first icon shows a row being inserted after the current row. The second icon shows the current row being deleted.
The first drop-down box descibes the row format. The options are Default, Heading and Total. These are formatting hints to tell the stylesheet what we are storing in the row, so that the correct style can be shown for the row when we print or otherwise render the report.
The second drop-down box is the Page-Break setting for the row. The options are None, Before, After, Before-Sheet, and After-Sheet. The default value is None. If you pick Before or After, when the report is printed it will have a page break either before or after the row, depending on the setting.
Before-Sheet and After-Sheet are the same as Before and After, except when rendering to an Excel spreadsheet. On a spreadsheet, Before-Sheet and After-Sheet create a new sheet instead of a page throw.

<section>
	<title>Column Options
</title>
	<description>The second section of the toolbar deals with column options. The icons are for inserting and deleting the current row. The dropdown is for the column format, Default, Heading or Total. These are relevant if the detail fields are in rows.

	<title>Box Options

<section>
	<title>Clear Formatting

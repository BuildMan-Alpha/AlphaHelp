<p class=A3Topic>Sub-Reports</p>



<p class=A5><a name=Creating_Sub_Reports>Creating Sub-Reports</a></p>



<p>A sub-report is an entire report that is placed in the <span class=Bolded>Detail</span> 
 area of another report. Its main purpose is to display data from tables 
 linked in a set using one-to-many links at the same level. A common example 
 of this is a set used to track Charges and Payments on an account. For 
 example, you want to create a report for the following set: </p>



<p class=Pix><img src="images/Account_Set_diagram.gif"
					x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
					style="float: none;
							width: 214px;
							height: 200px;
							border-style: none;
							border-style: none;"
					width=214
					height=200
					border=0></p>



<p class=PixCaption>Account Set Diagram</p>



<p>The parent of the set, <span class=Code1>Customer</span>, is linked 
 to two tables <span class=Code1>Charge</span> and <span class=Code1>Payment</span>. 
 In both cases a one-to-many link is used. If you wanted to create a report 
 that lists the charges and payments for each customer, you could put fields 
 from each table in the detail edit region. When the report prints, the 
 <span class=Code1>Charge</span> list first and then the <span class=Code1>Payment</span>. 
 If you want the data from the tables to appear side-by-side, instead of 
 one-after-the-other, you can use a sub-report. An example of this type 
 of layout is shown below: </p>



<p class=Pix><img src="images/Sub_Report.gif"
					x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
					style="float: none;
							width: 599px;
							height: 125px;
							border-style: none;
							border-style: none;"
					width=599
					height=125
					border=0></p>



&nbsp;

<p>When the report is run, the sub-report data prints side-by-side. To 
 create a sub-report.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>When the <span class=Screen>Create 
 Sub-report</span> dialog box appears, assign a <span class=Control>Name</span> 
 (which appears only in Design Mode) for the report.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Optionally, make 
 a selection from the <span class=Control>Filter on table</span> drop-down 
 list. This selection specifies the table that supplies the sub-report's 
 data. For example, if you are creating a sub-report to list records from 
 the Credits table, choose Credits from the drop-down list box.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Optionally, enter 
 an expression in the <span class=Control>Specify Filter</span> field. 
 This expression, which must evaluate to a logical value, selects the records

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Place the sub-report

 by double-clicking on the sub-report.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p class=A5><a name=Filtering_Sub_Report_Records>Filtering Sub-Report&nbsp;Records</a></p>



<p>You can filter the records that appear in a sub-report by using the 
 Sub-report's <span class=Screen>Detail Properties</span> dialog box. To 
 get to this dialog box while editing the sub-report:</p>



<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Select the sub-report.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Select <span class=Button>Report 
 > Properties > Detail Properties</span>.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Display the <span 
 class=Screen>Records</span> tab.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>See <a href="Ordering and Selecting Records.html" title="Ordering and Selecting Records" class="wiki">Ordering   and Selecting Records</a> for more information.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p class=A5><a name=Sub_Report_Filter_Expressions>Sub-Report Filter Expressions</a></p>



<p>When a sub-report is created, Alpha Anywhere uses the name of the table 
 you selected in the <span class=Screen>Create Subreport</span> dialog 
 box to create the default filter expression: SCANNING("TABLE NAME"), 
 where TABLE NAME is the name of the table you selected. This filter expression 
 evaluates to TRUE when records are being retrieved from the chosen child 
 table. It evaluates to FALSE when records are being retrieved from a different 
 child table. If you want to create your own filter expression, use the 
 logical operator .AND. to connect your filter expression to the one Alpha 
 Five creates.</p>



<p>For example, your sub-report lists Amounts from the Payments table. 
 By default, Alpha Anywhere creates the filter expression <span class=Code1>SCANNING("PAYMENTS")</span>. 
 If you want to see only amounts over five dollars, you can change the 
 filter expression to read: <span class=Code1>SCANNING("PAYMENTS") 
 .AND. AMOUNT > 5</span>.</p>



<p>The filter expression selects only records in which data is retrieved 
 from the Payments table AND only records in which the value of the field 
 Amount is more than five.</p>



<p class=A5><a name=Setting_the_Subgroup_Parameter_for_a_Sub_Report>Setting 
 the Subgroup&nbsp;Parameter for a Sub-Report</a></p>



<p>If you place a sub-report inside a report (the "main" report), 
 then the sub-report will have a detail section, and the main report will 
 also have a detail section. When you create summary calculations, you 
 may have to qualify which detail section you are referring to.</p>



<p>For example, assume that the sub-report is called "Subreport 1". 
 To refer to the detail section in this sub-report, you would need to specify 
 "Subreport 1:detail". Suppose that this sub-report is grouped 
 on <span class=Code1>Invoice_number</span> and you wanted to total a field 
 called <span class=Code1>Amount_due</span> in the Group Footer of the 
 sub-report. To do so, you would specify this expression:</p>




<table class="codeTable" style="x-cell-content-align: top;
				border-left-style: None;
				border-right-style: None;
				border-top-style: None;
				border-bottom-style: None;
				width: 100%;
				border-spacing: 0px;
				border-spacing: 0px;" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<col style="width: 100%;">

<tr style="x-cell-content-align: top;" valign="top">
<td style="x-cell-content-align: top;
			width: 100%;
			padding-right: 10px;
			padding-left: 10px;" valign="top" width="100%">
<p class=Code>Total(invoice_items->amount_due, grp->invoice_number, 
 grp->Subreport 1:detail)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If you just specify <span class=Code1>grp->detail</span>, Alpha Anywhere 
 assumes you are referring to records in the main report's detail section. 
 Note that the "invoice_number" group does not need to be prefixed 
 with "Subreport 1". This is because when you insert a group 
 in a report or a sub-report, you can specify the name of the group, and 
 are therefore able to specify unique group names for all of the groups 
 in a report and its sub-reports.</p>

	<description>You can preview the chart and adjust the parameters until you are satisfied with its appearance. In preview mode the "URL" or "URI" generated to describe the current chart can be copied and saved for future use.
Save the form after pressing OK on the chart builder.
If you want to modify the chart after it has been saved to the form, right-click on the chart and select SuperControl Designer... from the context menu.

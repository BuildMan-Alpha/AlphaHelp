<description>The Vendors, Details, and Products tabs of the Vendors form each display a selection of fields from the Vendors set. Because the records are coming from a set, which links the data from the Vendor and Product tables, selecting a record in the browse on the Vendor tab automatically displays the appropriate records on the Details and Products and tabs.

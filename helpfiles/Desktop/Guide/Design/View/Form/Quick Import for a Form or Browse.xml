	<topic>Quick Import for a Form or Browse</topic>
	<description>A new option the the Records menu for a Form or Browse allows you to import data from an Excel file or a comma delimited ascii file directly into the current table (i.e. the table that the open Browse or Form is based on).
The file you are importing must have field names in the first row that match field names in the current record.

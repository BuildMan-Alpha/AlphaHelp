<description>In older versions, .fetch_first(), .fetch_prev(), .fetch_next() and .fetch_last() all navigate at the level of the top table in the Form (i.e. the parent table of the Set on which the Form is based).
This means that if a user included fields from child one-to-many tables on the Form (but did not include an embedded browse for the one-to-many child table), there was no way to easily navigate the records in the one-to-many child tables.
Version 10 added support for an optional 'table' parameter to all the .fetch_*() functions. This allows navigation of a specified child table. You can also use the special psuedo-table called '' to navigate through records in the currently selected table.

	<description>The Find by Form dialog box is available on forms only, and lets you type search criteria directly into the same form you are viewing. Find by Form does not filter out records that do not meet your search criteria, or put records in order. It simply displays the next or previous matching record.
Find by Form opens a blank record for you to enter search criteria. For example, if you are looking for a record for a person with the last name " Jenkins ," type " Jenkins " in the LASTNAME field.

<description>The Find Text... command displays the Locate dialog box, which is available in both forms and browses. The dialog box lets you find the next or previous record containing the text, number, date, or series of characters you specify. You can keep the dialog open while you work on your form or Browse.
When finding text, Alpha Anywhere displays the record and that contains the first match and places the cursor on the field that contains the match.

	<description>To use Find Text:
</description>
<steps>
	<step>
		<description>In a form or browse, click Find > Find Text.
</description>
	</step>
	<step>
		<description>Optionally, click Current Field to search only in the current field.
</description>
	</step>
	<step>
		<description>Optionally, click Backwards to search towards the top of the file.
</description>
	</step>
	<step>
		<description>Type a value in the Search for text box. The search criteria you specify does not need to match exactly; you can match word fragments. For example, if you search for the word "data", Locate will find both "data" and "database".
</description>
	</step>
	<step>
		<description>Click Find.
</description>
		<note>Using Find by Key is much faster than Locate (when an appropriate index exists), particularly when a table has very many records.</note>

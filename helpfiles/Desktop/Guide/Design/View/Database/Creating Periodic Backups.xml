To create periodic backups:
</description>
	<steps>
		<step>
			<description>Select View > Settings > Workspace > Backup Workspace.
</description>
			<cases>
				<case>

					<description>Alpha Anywhere also lets you create "snapshots" of your workspace, so that you can go back to a particular backup of your workspace. For example, the backup you made on June 25th, 1999 at 4.35 PM.

			<title>Marking and Unmarking Records</title>
			<description>Using a form or browse, you can select a group of records by marking them. Marked records can be viewed, printed, or processed separately from other records. To mark a record, navigate to a record and press CTRL M or select Records > Mark. To unmark a record,
				navigate to a marked record and press CTRL U or select Records > Unmark. For example, you have a table of customer records and you want to send some of them bonus coupons. However, you only want to send coupons to your best customers. You can navigate from
				record-to-record and only mark the records of customers to whom you want to send coupons. Once the records are marked, you can print only those records by setting a range before printing.</description>

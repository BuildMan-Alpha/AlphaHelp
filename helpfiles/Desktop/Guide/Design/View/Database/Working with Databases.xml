	<description>Tables, sets, and workspaces are the primary structures for storing data in Alpha Anywhere.
Your workspace files keep track of all of the tables, sets, toolbars, forms, and such, used for managing information. When you open an existing workspace, Alpha Anywhere displays the objects (tables, forms, etc.) that make up the workspace in the Control Panel. With Alpha Anywhere, you work with one workspace at a time.
Typically, you create different workspaces for unrelated uses. For example, if you keep track of information for your business and your home, you might create one workspace for your business and one for your home.
Good design practices suggest that:
</description>
<cases>
	<case>
		<description>Each workspace have its own unique folder, unless
</description>
	</case>
	<case>
		<description>Two or more workspaces have common tables or interact, in which case the folders should be the same.

	</case>

	<step>
		<description>Optionally, change the name or folder location of the zip file to create.

	</step>
	<step>
		<description>Optionally, check Compact Workspace before zipping. This potentially reduces the size of the zip file.
</description>
	</step>
	<step>
		<description>Optionally, check Include absolute path names in zip file. This causes the files to be upzipped to the same location they came from and may be a problem if unzipped on a different computer.
</description>
<note>By default Alpha Anywhere includes all related files (i.e., indexes, dictionaries, and Help files) in the zip file. For example, when you zip a set, Alpha Anywhere automatically includes all of the tables that comprise the set. However, you can select files to include and exclude.</note>
	</step>
	<step>
		<description>Optionally, sort the files in the list box by Extension, Name, or Natural (the order in which the files appear in the workspace).

	<description>The new {htmlhost} control differs from the {html} control in that it can host Xdialog controls. </description>

		<description>The way Xdialog controls are hosted is by adding a 'a5:xdialog' attribute to an html tag, which will cause the Xdialog control to live in the html element: when the html element is visible, the control is shown; when the html element is hidden, the control is hidden; and most importantly, when the html layout changes due to a resize, the Xdialog control moves and resizes itself to the element.

In the below example note that color listbox uses the exact same format you would use to define a normal xdialog listbox, but that you can omit the size from the xdialog control since the size is controlled by the html. Note that the div elements that contain a5:xdialog attributes all have width and height defined. This is important to remember, because if you omit a size, chances are good that the xdialog control will be created 0x0 pixels in size.

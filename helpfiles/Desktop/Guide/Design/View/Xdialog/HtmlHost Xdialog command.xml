	<description>The new {htmlhost} control differs from the {html} control in that the {htmlhost} control can host Xdialog controls inside an HTML shell, while the {html} hosts HTML inside an Xdialog shell. You can nest them if you wish, that is an {htmlhost} control can host Xdialog controls which may in turn host {html} controls, but this is not necessary, as the {htmlhost} control has plenty of flexibility.

The {html} control differs from the {htmlIE} control in that the {html} control uses Alpha's built-in HTML rendering engine while the {htmlIE} control uses the Microsoft Internet Explorer rendering engine. The {htmlhost} control uses Alpha's built-in HTML rendering engine, just like the {html} control.</description>

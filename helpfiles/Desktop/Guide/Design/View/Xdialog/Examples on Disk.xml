		<description>All of the examples presented in this book are available on disk. In the "Learning Xdialog" folder off your main Alpha Anywhere program folder, you will find the "Learning Xdialog" database.
Open this database. The main menu appears where you can select the scripts. Of course, this main menu is itself a dialog box created using Xdialog.  
</description>
		<note>If this dialog does not appear, go to the Code tab of the Control Panel and double-click on the script called "Main_Menu".</note>

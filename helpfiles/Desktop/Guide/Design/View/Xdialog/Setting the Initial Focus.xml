	<description>By default the control that has focus when a dialog is opened is the first control on the dialog, however, you may specify a different control.   The {initial_focus} command is used to do this.
Here is an example where the third edit control in this dialog box gets the initial focus:

	<example><![CDATA[ui_dlg_box("Title",<<%dlg%
{region}
First|[.20first];
Second |[.20second];
Third |{initial_focus}[.20third];
Fourth|[.20fourth]
{endregion};
{region}
<*15&OK> <15&Cancel>
{endregion}
%dlg% ) ]]></example>

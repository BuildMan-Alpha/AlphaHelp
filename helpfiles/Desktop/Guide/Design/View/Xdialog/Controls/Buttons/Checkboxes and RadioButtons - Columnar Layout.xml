	<description>In previous versions you could specify that the choices in a checkbox or radiobutton group should be laid out vertically or horizontally. However, if there were a lot of choices, this tended to look unattractive. Now there is a new option to lay out the choices in multiple rows and columns. You can specify the 'snaking' style - left-to-right-then-top-to-bottom, or top-to-bottom-then-left-to-right. The following image shows radiobutton choices in a mult-column list with the snaking style set to left-to-right.</description>

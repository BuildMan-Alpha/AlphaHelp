<p class=A3Topic>Keeping Applications Healthy</p>



<p>The following recommendations for keeping your distributed applications 
 healthy come from experienced Alpha Anywhere developers.</p>



<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Implement and then use 
 a good, frequent backup system. It's not a question of if you will have 
 a problem, it's a question only of when.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>If your workstations are 
 using <span class=Screen>Windows 98</span>, turn them off at night. All 
 the way off, powered down. Discourage users from multi-tasking with other 
 large applications. Alpha Anywhere needs all the horsepower these systems 
 can muster.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Maintain a trouble log. 
 This is a journal of sorts; a place where user problems are written down 
 and the solutions, too.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Think about version control, 
 and systems for distributing changes when modifications become necessary. 
 Create something that makes sense to you, and then use it. Be certain 
 to document your changes and to keep backups of interim versions, in case 
 you have to roll back to an earlier one.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Investigate automating 
 some housekeeping functions if you have not already. (Index rebuilding 
 and reconstruction, zip file backup creation before critical changes (end 
 of month?) for possible rollback, etc.)</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Error logging (logging 
 errors to a table) to capture potential problems. Similarly, user logging 
 is also helpful at time, e.g. recording when users do a major operation, 
 like printing report, importing/exporting, whatever you deemed important. 
 This returns numbers that allow you to see what is used frequently, and 
 then can be optimized&nbsp;as&nbsp;Needed.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>If using memo fields, there 
 are many techniques that can be used to improve reliability.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p class=A3Topic>About Activating Alpha Five</p>



<p class=A5>What Is Activation?</p>



<p>Each Alpha Five license allows you to install Alpha Five on one machine 
 (your primary machine), and a personal portable machine that is not connected 
 to the same network&nbsp;as&nbsp;your primary machine.</p>



<p>Activation is the process that ties your copy of Alpha Five to the machines 
 on which it was activated.</p>



<p class=A5>Why Does Alpha Software Require Activation?</p>



<p>Activation helps to prevent unauthorized use of Alpha Five. We feel 
 that this is in the best interests of both Alpha Five users, and Alpha 
 Software, because it will allow us to invest more in the future development 
 of Alpha Five.</p>



<p class=A5>Is it Difficult to Activate Alpha Five?</p>



<p>Our Activation process is extremely easy. If you activate Alpha Five 
 over the Internet, you can complete the process in just a few minutes. 
 If your computer is not connected to the Internet, then you can activate 
 Alpha Five by telephone, mail, or fax.</p>



<p>If you are connected to the Internet, in the main Alpha Five menu select 
 <span class=Button>Help > Activate Alpha Five > Request an Activation 
 Key</span>. </p>

							width: 600px;
							height: 317px;
							border-style: none;
							border-style: none;"
					width=600
					height=317
					border=0></p>



<p>If you are not connected to the Internet, contact Alpha Software by 
 telephone, fax, or mail. When you receive your activation key from Alpha 
 Software:</p>



<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Select <span class=Button>Help 
 > Activate Alpha Five > Enter an Activation Key</span>.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Enter your Activation 
 Key exactly&nbsp;as&nbsp;it was provided to you.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p class=A5>Grace Period</p>



<p>After Alpha Five is initially installed on a computer it will work without 
 having to be activated for 45 days. This period is referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;the 
 "grace period". Once the grace period has expired, you will 
 no longer be able to run Alpha Five on that computer until it has been 
 activated. </p>

<p>If you select <span class=Button>Request Activation Key for Alpha Five 
 Now</span>, the following screen appears. If you select <span class=Button>Online</span>, 
 then click <span class=Button>Send Activation Request over the Internet</span>. 
 </p>

<p class=A5><a name=What_is_an_Activation_Key_>What is an Activation Key?</a></p>



<p>An activation key is a system generated code based on the combination 
 of your Alpha license number and the "Machine Name" of your 
 computer.</p>



<p>What is your "Machine Name"? The easiest way to get your "Machine 
 Name" is to open up Alpha Five and select <span class=Button>Help 
 > About Alpha Five...</span>. The resulting dialog box contains your 
 license number and "Machine Name". </a></p>

<p class=A5>Help us help you</p>



<p>Some people have an activation problem when they re-install Alpha Five, 
 reformat their hard drives, or replace computers.</p>



<p>If you have a problem, the first thing to do is make a note of your 
 license number(s) and the "Machine Name(s)" of the computers 
 that the software is installed on. (You can find this out by going through 
 the process explained above).</p>



<p>Remember that the activation key is linked to the license number and 
 the "Machine Name" of the computer, so if you ever have to re-install 
 your OS, then you want to rename your computer the same that it was named 
 before. For example, if your laptop is called "LAPTOP" and you 
 need to reformat your hard drive, it is quite possible that the name of 
 your computer will default to a system name, so rather try and rename 
 it "LAPTOP" and you will not have any further problems regarding 
 the activation of the software. If however you are not able to rename 
 the computer the same name, then you will need to notify our customer 
 service department of the change. We will then de-activate the old "name" 
 and this will in turn allow you to re-activate with the new name.</p>



<p class=A5><a name="Customer Support for Activation Issues">How can you 
 help us?</a></p>



<p>If you need to contact Alpha Software regarding activation, please supply&nbsp;as&nbsp;much 
 information&nbsp;as&nbsp;possible.</p>



<p>You will want to include your Alpha Five license number(s) and the affected 
 "Machine Name(s)". You can simply send us an email (  
 ) with the following information.</p>



<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Your license number(s).</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>The affected "Machine 
 Name" that you wish to be removed.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>If need be, the "Machine 
 Name" of the new computer.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>We will then process the necessary requests for you and email back the 
 new activation keys.</p>



<p>Remember in an emergency, you can always rename your computer to what 
 it was before, and you will not need to re-activate the software, and 
 that is why it is important to make a note of your current license numbers 
 and "Machine Names".</p>

			<title>What Is Activation?</title>
			<description>Each Alpha Anywhere license allows you to install Alpha Anywhere on one machine (your primary machine), and a personal portable machine that is not connected to the same network as your primary machine.
Activation is the process that ties your copy of Alpha Anywhere to the machines on which it was activated.

			<title>Why Does Alpha Software Require Activation?</title>
			<description>Activation helps to prevent unauthorized use of Alpha Anywhere. We feel that this is in the best interests of both Alpha Anywhere users, and Alpha Software, because it will allow us to invest more in the future development of Alpha Anywhere.

			<title>Grace Period
</title>
			<description>After Alpha Anywhere is initially installed on a computer it will work without having to be activated for 45 days. This period is referred to as the "grace period". Once the grace period has expired, you will no longer be able to run Alpha Anywhere on that computer until it has been activated.

			<title>What is an Activation Key?
</title>
			<description>An activation key is a system generated code based on the combination of your Alpha license number and the "Machine Name" of your computer.
What is your "Machine Name"? The easiest way to get your "Machine Name" is to open up Alpha Anywhere and select Help > About Alpha Anywhere.... The resulting dialog box contains your license number and "Machine Name".

			<title>Help us help you</title>
			<description>Some people have an activation problem when they re-install Alpha Anywhere, reformat their hard drives, or replace computers.
If you have a problem, the first thing to do is make a note of your license number(s) and the "Machine Name(s)" of the computers that the software is installed on. (You can find this out by going through the process explained above).
Remember that the activation key is linked to the license number and the "Machine Name" of the computer, so if you ever have to re-install your OS, then you want to rename your computer the same that it was named before. For example, if your laptop is called "LAPTOP" and you need to reformat your hard drive, it is quite possible that the name of your computer will default to a system name, so rather try and rename it "LAPTOP" and you will not have any further problems regarding the activation of the software. If however you are not able to rename the computer the same name, then you will need to notify our customer service department of the change. We will then de-activate the old "name" and this will in turn allow you to re-activate with the new name.

			<title>How can you help us?</title>
			<description>If you need to contact Alpha Software regarding activation, please supply as much information as possible.
You will want to include your Alpha Anywhere license number(s) and the affected "Machine Name(s)". You can simply send us an email ( ) with the following information.
</description>
			<cases>
				<case>
					<description>Your license number(s).
</description>
				</case>
				<case>
					<description>The affected "Machine Name" that you wish to be removed.
</description>
				</case>
				<case>
					<description>If need be, the "Machine Name" of the new computer.

			<description>We will then process the necessary requests for you and email back the new activation keys.
Remember in an emergency, you can always rename your computer to what it was before, and you will not need to re-activate the software, and that is why it is important to make a note of your current license numbers and "Machine Names".

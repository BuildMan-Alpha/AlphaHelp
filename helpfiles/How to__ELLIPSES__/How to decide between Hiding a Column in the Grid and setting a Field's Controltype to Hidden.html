There is a big conceptual difference between:<br />
<br />
1. checking the 'Hide' checkbox for a field in the grid, and<br />
2. setting a grid control type to 'Hidden'<br />
<br />
In the former case, you might have checked the 'Hide' checkbox even though you fully intend to display that field in the grid.<br />
<br />
How is that possible? Well, the grid allows any column to be a 'free-form layout'.<br />
<br />
So let's say you check the 'Hide' property for the 'Lastname' column. (which would then hide the Lastname in the grid), but you then went to the 'Firstname' column and checked the 'Has Freeform Layout' property. Then you specified this for the freeform layout template:<br />
<br />
<span style="color:blue; background:">{firstname} {lastname}</span><br />
<br />
What this achieves is this: The 'column' for the 'Lastname' field is hidden. But the data for the lastname field is displayed in the 'Firstname' column (in the freeform edit region). So, what you have achieved here is: hidden the 'lastname' COLUMN, while still displaying the 'lastname' FIELD. The 'lastname' field is displayed using the control type you assigned to it.<br />
<br />
On the other hand if you set the 'lastname' control type to 'hidden' then that does NOT automatically hide the 'lastname' column. but there is no data visible in the column when the grid renders because the control type is hidden.<br />
<br />
If you check the 'Hide' property on a column in the Grid, but DO NOT PUT THAT FIELD IN ANOTHER FIELD'S FREE-FORM LAYOUT REGION, then Alpha Anywhere does some automatic fix up for you behind the scenes.<br />
<br />
Here is what it does<br />
1. It converts the control type of the column you hid to 'Hidden'<br />
2. It puts the field into the first 'free form layout' region it finds (assuming some other column in the grid has a free form layout)<br />
3. If no other column in the grid has a free from layout, then it make one of the other columns in the grid into a free form layout and it puts that column that you hid into this free-form region.<br />
<br />
The reason that it does this is that people often were checking the 'Hide' property, but then referring to a value in the field in their link expressions, or client-side javascript expressions.<br />

The S_QUOTE() function properly quotes variables so they can be used in expressions.
 Note : Do not use S_QUOTE()  in HTML expressions. It escapes quote characters in a manner inconsistent with HTML coding requirements.

If the type of data that you are quoting is a character variable, and it has one or more CR-LFs in it, then S_QUOTE() automatically uses the long string format.

<![CDATA[
  list1 = comma_to_crlf("A,B,C")
? s_quote(list1)
= 
A
B

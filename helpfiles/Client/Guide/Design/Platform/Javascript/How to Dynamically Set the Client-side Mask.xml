		<title>Setting a JavaScript Function for a Conditional Mask</title>
		<description>You can now specify a JavaScript function to dynamically compute the mask for a control. The JavaScript function gets called every time the control gets focus. When the JavaScript function gets called, it can read data in the current Grid row, (or Dialog) and compute the mask to use based on this data. For example, say you have a mask for a telephone number field. In the US, UK and Europe, different formats are used for telephone numbers. The JavaScript function can decide what format string to return based on the current value of the 'COUNTRY' field.</description>

		<title>Changing a Mask Programmatically</title>
	<description>Say you have defined a client-side data entry mask for a field and you want to dynamically change the mask for the field using some JavaScript code, but don't want to use the JavaScript function method for a Conditional Mask discussed above. Here is how you can do it programmatically in any client-side event of your choosing. The key to this is the ._editParseMask() method.

	<example><![CDATA[var x = {grid.object}._fieldHelpers_G['FIELD1'];
x.format.mask = '(0)(0)';
x.format._pMask = x._editParseMask(x.format.mask);]]></example>

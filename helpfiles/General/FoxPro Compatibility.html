<p class=A3Topic>FoxPro Compatibility</p>



<p>Alpha Five uses <span class=Screen>FoxPro</span> v2.6 tables. The current 
 versions of FoxPro ( <span class=Screen>Visual FoxPro 6</span> and above) 
 have a different file format. Alpha Five cannot read these newer FoxPro 
 formats. However, the newer versions of FoxPro can still read their old 
 format (the format that Alpha Five uses).</p>



<p>If your FoxPro application is using old style FoxPro tables (so called 
 "free tables" in FoxPro terminology), then it would be safe 
 for an Alpha Five application and a FoxPro application to be running simultaneously 
 in most situations.</p>



<p>The situation in which it would not be safe is if you have defined an 
 index and used a function in the index definition that FoxPro does not 
 understand. For example, and index on <span class=Code1>w_upper(fname)</span> 
 or <span class=Code1>ut(fname) + lname</span> would cause a problem because 
 <span class=Code1>w_upper()</span> and <span class=Code1>ut()</span> are 
 Alpha Five functions that don't exist in FoxPro. So, at worst you will 
 get an index corruption (which is easily fixed by rebuilding indexes). 
 However, no data should be lost.</p>



<p>FoxPro should see record locks applied by Alpha Five and vice versa.</p>

<p class=A3Topic>Sessions </p>



<p>Web requests are stateless, that is each request from a client (web 
 browser) to a server is separate from any previous requests and no information 
 about previous requests is available to the current request. You should 
 think of each page&nbsp;as&nbsp;a separate Xbasic script - once one is 
 finished, the next knows nothing about the previous. This can make the 
 building of web applications quite difficult&nbsp;as&nbsp;the developer 
 needs to track this state information within each web page returned by 
 the server.</p>



<p>The <span class=Screen>Application Server</span> uses sessions and <a href="Sessions.html#Session_Variables" title="Sessions" class="wiki">Session Variables</a> (as explained 
 below) to overcome this limitation of web servers.&nbsp;as&nbsp;long&nbsp;as&nbsp;the 
 server is licensed for a sufficient number of sessions, a request from 
 a client will cause a new session to be created. The server will then 
 associate future requests from that client with the same session until 
 the session expires. A <a name=session_expires>session expires</a> when 
 a request has not been received from the associated client within the 
 time period set by <span class=Bolded>Session Lifetime</span>.</p>



<p>Sessions are normally tracked with <span class=Bolded>cookies</span>. 
 However, clients are not required to accept cookies. Furthermore, you 
 can turn off the use of cookies for session tracking altogether in the 
 <span class=Screen>Application Server Control Panel</span>. However when 
 cookies are turned off or cookies are not enabled on a specific client 
 computer, the server must work harder to track the session state, which 
 has a performance impact. The recommendation is to leave cookies on and 
 let the server automatically fall back to the cookieless operation only 
 when required by a specific client connection.</p>



<p>When a session is created by the server, some information is automatically 
 stored in it - the <span class=Bolded>session ID</span> and a <span class=Bolded>timestamp</span>.&nbsp;as&nbsp;an 
 application developer, you can also store other information in the session 
 in order to make it available to subsequent requests without explicitly 
 passing it to that request.</p>



<p>To create a "session" level variable, simply name it <span 
 class=Code1>session.varname</span>. It will then be persistent across 
 all page views and can be later referenced&nbsp;as&nbsp; <span class=Code1>session.varname</span> 
 in subsequent pages.</p>



<p>To illustrate this limitation of web programming and the session solution, 
 look at the following example.</p>

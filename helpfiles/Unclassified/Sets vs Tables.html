<p class=A3Topic>Sets vs Tables</p>



<p>Alpha Five is a relational database management system. A relational 
 system allows you establish links between data in several tables.</p>



<p>In a flat-file system, each table is often designed to include all the 
 relevant information required for a particular application or use (such&nbsp;as&nbsp;inventory 
 or invoicing). This creates larger tables that often store redundant data. 
 For example, an order entry system used to produce invoices might be composed 
 of a single table. This tale must include fields to store both customer 
 information and the invoice detail information that describes the items 
 ordered. For example, the following Invoice database can have to three 
 items per invoice. </p>



<p class=Pix><img src="images/Flat_File_Invoicing_System.gif"
					x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
					style="border: none;
							width: 126px;
							height: 290px;
							float: none;
							border-style: none;
							border-style: none;"
					width=126
					height=290
					border=0></p>



<p>This approach:</p>



<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Limits the number of line 
 items that you can associate with each record. You must determine how 
 many groups of fields to include for repeating information (e.g. the invoice 
 line items) and include these in the table.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Causes you to duplicate 
 efforts and store redundant information. In the invoicing example, you 
 must enter a customer's name and address each time you place an order, 
 even though the customer information may already exist. For instance, 
 if the customer has ordered before, the customer's information exists 
 in another record.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a relational system, you can design tables to store data more 
 efficiently. You typically create more and smaller tables and then establish 
 links between them.</p>



<p>For example, an order entry system might be divided into four tables: 
 Invoice header, Invoice item, Customer, and Product. All customer information 
 is stored in the Customer table which contains one record for each customer. 
 All product information is stored in the Product table. Each transaction 
 (or invoice) is represented by a record in the Invoice Header table, and 
 the invoice's line-items are all stored&nbsp;as&nbsp;individual records 
 in the Invoice Items table. </p>



<p class=Pix><img src="images/Multiple_File_Invoicing_System.gif"
					x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
					style="border: none;
							width: 458px;
							height: 273px;
							float: none;
							border-style: none;
							border-style: none;"
					width=458
					height=273
					border=0></p>



<p>By separating the invoice line items from the invoice, you can have 
 a virtually unlimited number of line items, since they are stored&nbsp;as&nbsp;separate 
 records in the INV_ITEM.DBF table. Since fields for invoice line-item 
 information do not exist and are not repeated in the INV_HEAD.DBF table, 
 no space is wasted on unused items.</p>



<p>Separate Customer and Product tables also helps eliminate redundant 
 information.</p>

	<topic>What are Components?</topic>
<description>Components are collections of client-side and server-side code that give your application its look, feel, and functionality. You create them through the use of component builders in the Alpha Anywhere Developer IDE. 
 There are currently 15 types of components, each with a corresponding builder. Most of these are for specific tasks such as the Video Player component for playing videos, and the Google Map component for displaying maps. 
 There is also a special component called the UX component, which is used to build the application's interface. In practise, many mobile applications will consist of just a single UX component. </description>

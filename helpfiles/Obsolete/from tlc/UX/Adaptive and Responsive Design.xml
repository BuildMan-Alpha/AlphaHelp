	<description>Applications that need to adapt to varying screen sizes or orientations can use either adaptive design, responsive design, or a combination. Adaptive designs determine the size and orientation of a device, and present a different interface depending on the device. Responsive designs change the shape and positioning of controls on the device using a single interface that in which the controls (text fields, buttons, images, etc) can move to new positions and change size. Both approaches are discussed below. </description>

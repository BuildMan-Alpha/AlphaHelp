<h1>Tutorial 1: Hello World</h1>
<p>
The point of any "hello world" type of tutorial is to show a beginner how to
perform a simple task, so that they get a feel for how to interact with a
programming language or development environment. The task is usually to
display "Hello World" on the screen.
<br/><br/>
This Hello World example takes the idea a bit further, and shows you how to
build a mobile application that has a button on its opening screen. When you
press the button, another screen opens with the text "Hello World." There
is then another button to take you back.
<br/><br/>

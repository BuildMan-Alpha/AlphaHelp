<description>Developers who want to use Alpha Anywhere are encouraged to start the tutorials, which take you step by step though the development environment to build some simple applications. 
Below are three tutorials, and it is suggested that you complete them in order.

<title>Tutorial 1: Hello World</title>
<description>The point of any "hello world" type of tutorial is to show a beginner how to perform a simple task, so that they get a feel for how to interact with a programming language or development environment. The task is usually to display "Hello World" on the screen. 
This Hello World example takes the idea a bit further, and shows you how to build a mobile application that has a button on its opening screen. When you press the button, another screen opens with the text "Hello World." There is then another button to take you back.

	<title>Tutorial 2: Working With SQL Data in a List</title>
<description>Once you've completed the Hello World tutorial, this tutorial shows you how to build another two-panel mobile application. This time, the first screen shows a list of customers from a sample SQL database. When you click on a customer, a detail screen appears in which you view and can edit details about a particular customer.

	<title>Tutorial 3: Photo App Tutorial</title>
<description>This tutorial is more ambitious than the Hello World and Master/Detail tutorials. In this tutorial, you will build a real application over the course of about 90 minutes. 
 You begin the tutorial by setting up a SQL table, which you then use to build a browser application. The application is then further built to work on a mobile device, and to access a phone camera. 
 The pace is slow enough so that you can build the application along with the video, without needing to stop and rewind. If you have a second monitor, or a tablet, we suggest that you view the video on that while following along in Alpha Anywhere to build the application.

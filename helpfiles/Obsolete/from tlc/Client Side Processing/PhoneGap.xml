<description>PhoneGap is an open-source framework from Adobe Systems Inc. that allows HTML5 applications, such as those created by Alpha Anywhere, to take advantage of the hardware and system software included in mobile phones. Typically this functionality is only available to application written natively (as opposed to HTML5 applications). The primary benefit is that you can create a single application that runs on iOS, Android, or Windows mobile devices, instead of writing Native code unique to each one.

		<description>PhoneGap Build is a web service that takes your application assets (the HTML, Javascript, CSS, images and other files) and packages them up for use on each mobile platform so you test them or distribute them. 
 To save you time, Alpha Anywhere Developer includes a system to gather these files, and send them to PhoneGap Build. For details, see the [PhoneGap Introduction Video] (9m12s) and the  [Getting Started with PhoneGap PDF]. </description>

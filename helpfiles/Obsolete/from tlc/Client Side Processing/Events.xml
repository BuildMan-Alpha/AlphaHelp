<description>Events are actions that happen in your application that can trigger Javascript code. Examples include pressing a button, swiping a screen, changing a field value, and many others.

		<description>Alpha Anywhere provides hooks to these events in the various component builders (such as the UX builder). Generally they can be found in the Properties panel on the right. 

 For many controls, Alpha lists two sets of events - one called Javascript Events, the other called Javascript Touch, Mouse, Pointer Events. Javascript Touch, Mouse, Pointer Events are generally the events you should use and are optimized for both mobile and desktop/web. The others are included only for backwards compatibility and can perform sluggishly in mobile applications. 

 You can either supply the Javascript yourself, or use Action Javascript to build the Javascript for you. </description>

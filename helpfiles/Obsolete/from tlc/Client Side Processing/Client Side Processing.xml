	<description>In cases where you need to add functionality that is not included Alpha Anywhwere, Alpha allows you to hook your own code up to application events. Events are actions that occur in your application, such as clicking a button, sliding a screen, changing the value of a field and many others. See Events To create the Javascript code you can either write it yourself, or use Action Javascript, which is a point and click builder that builds the Javascript for you. See Action Javascript.

	<description>PhoneGap Build is integrated with Alpha Anywhere, simplifying the process of creating native (hybrid) applications for Android, iOS, and Windows mobile devices. See PhoneGap. 
As a rapid application development system, Alpha creates much of the Javascript for you, so you can perform tasks like entering records and navigating screens without the need to do any coding. </description>

	<description>In cases where you need to add functionality that is not included Alpha Anywhwere, Alpha allows you to hook your own code up to application events. Events are actions that occur in your application, such as clicking a button, sliding a screen, changing the value of a field and many others. See Events To create the Javascript code you can either write it yourself, or use Action Javascript, which is a point and click builder that builds the Javascript for you. See Action Javascript.

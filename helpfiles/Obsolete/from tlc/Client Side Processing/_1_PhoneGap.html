<h1>PhoneGap</h1>

<p>
PhoneGap is an open-source framework from Adobe Systems Inc. that allows HTML5 applications, 
such as those created by Alpha Anywhere, to take advantage of the hardware and system
software included in mobile phones. Typically this functionality is only available 
to application written natively (as opposed to HTML5 applications). The primary benefit is 
that you can create a single application that runs on iOS, Android, or Windows mobile 
devices, instead of writing Native code  unique to each one. 


<br/><br/>

PhoneGap Build is a web service that takes your application assets (the HTML,
Javascript, CSS, images and other files) and packages them up for use on each mobile 
platform so you test them or distribute them. 
<br/><br/>
To save you time, Alpha Anywhere Developer includes a system to gather these files, and send them to 
PhoneGap Build. For details, see <a href="http://www.viddler.com/v/70c4d53?secret=83934891 ">the PhoneGap Introduction Video (9m12s)</a>

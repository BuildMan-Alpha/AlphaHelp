<description>Most business applications involve the collection of data, often in different formats. Alpha Anywhere can be used to capture a wide variety of data, listed below. So input methods make more sense for mobile devices, such as GPS capture, while others are generally used for web applications, such as the importing spreadsheet files. </description>
<cases>

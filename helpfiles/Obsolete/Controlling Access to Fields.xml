		<description>The security access level property is compared to a protected session variable named session.protectedSecurityLevel. Your application code should set this variable to reflect the access rights of the current user.
If the user has a security level lower than the field's security level, the field will be hidden. If the user has a security level equal to or greater than the field's security level, the field will be displayed.
The following picture shows 2 versions of the same grid. The grid on the left has field level security controls that hide the Credit Card Number and Expiration fields from users with inadequate security access levels.

			<h2>Override Settings in A5W Page</h2>
<p>The way in which an .a5w page that runs components is constructed has been  changed in V10.</p>
<p>In V9, if you examine an .a5w page after you have inserted a component into  the page, you will see an Xbasic code block that looks similar to this</p>
<p class="xbasic">with tmpl</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; componentname = "GRID1"</p>
<p class="xbasic">end with</p>
<p>The Xbasic between the opening 'with tmpl' and the closing 'end with' could  be used to override any of the Grid settings. So for example, if you wanted to  change the Grid style to a value that was set by a session variable called  session.style, you would have:</p>
<p class="xbasic">with tmpl</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; componentname = "GRID1"</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; style_name = session.style</p>
<p class="xbasic">end with</p>
<p>In V10, when you place a component on a page, the Xbasic code block in the  .a5w page where you override settings is slightly different. It now looks like  this:</p>
<p class="xbasic">tmpl.override_settings = <<%override_settings%</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; componentname = "GRID1"</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; style_name = session.style</p>
<p class="xbasic">%override_settings%</p>
<p class="xbasic">a5w_resolveVariablesInOverrideSettings(tmpl,session,local_variables())</p>
<p>The a5w_resolveVariablesInOverrideSettings() function resolves page and  session variables in the override_settings string. So, after this function has  been executed, the tmpl.override_settings property will contain this value  (assuming that session.style has a value of 'Airport':</p>
<p class="xbasic">tmpl.override_settings = <<%override_settings%</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; componentname = "GRID1"</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; style_name = "Airport"</p>
<p class="xbasic">%override_settings%</p>
<p>When you publish an existing .a5w page (created in V9), the Xbasic in the  .a5w code is automatically converted to the new V10 pattern.</p>
<!-- startAnchor --><a name="Why Was it Necessary to Make this Change?"></a><!-- endAnchor -->
<h3>Why Was it Necessary to Make this Change?</h3>
<p>The reason that is was necessary to change the code pattern is that with the  code pattern used in V9 and earlier, there is way to know <u><b>exactly which  properties</b></u> where changed in the override settings section of the code.  This was not a problem in V9 and earlier as there was no need to know which  properties had been overridden.</p>
<p>However, in an Ajax Grid, it is essential that we know which properties have  been overridden so that this information can be stored in a hidden field in the  Grid. This is&nbsp; necessary because after the Grid has been displayed initially,  all further callbacks are not handled by the original .a5w page (that contains  the override settings code), but are handled by a special page called  __a5RunGrid.a5w (which is published automatically every time you publish any  component).</p>
<p>Since the Ajax callbacks are processed using __a5RunGrid.a5w, (which is a  generic page with no override settings code in it), the override settings are  read from the hidden field in the Grid.</p>
<!-- startAnchor --><a name="Referencing Local Variables in the Override Settings String"></a><!-- endAnchor -->
<h3>Referencing Local Variables in the Override Settings String</h3>
<p>If you want to refer to local variables in the override_settings string, you  must prefix the local variable with 'pageVar' and you must put the local  variable in the special 'pageVar' variable frame.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p class="xbasic">dim rows as n</p>
<p class="xbasic">rows = 23</p>
<p class="xbasic">dim pageVars as p</p>
<p class="xbasic">pageVars.rows = rows</p>
<p class="xbasic">tmpl.override_settings = <<%override_settings%</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; componentname = "GRID1"</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; style_name = session.style</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rows = pageVars.rows</p>
<p class="xbasic">%override_settings%</p>
<p class="xbasic">a5w_resolveVariablesInOverrideSettings(tmpl,session,local_variables())</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

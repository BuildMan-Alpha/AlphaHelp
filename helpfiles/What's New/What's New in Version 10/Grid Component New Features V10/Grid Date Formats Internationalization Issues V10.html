			<h2>Date Formats - Internationalization Issues</h2>
<p>You can now more easily deal with situations where the date format that a  user wants to use is different than Regional Settings date format for your  server. For example, assume that your server is on a machine in the US where the  date format is 'MM/dd/yy'. Your users in the US who want to see and enter dates  using the 'MM/dd/yy' format. However, your users in the rest of the world want  to use the 'dd/MM/yy' format to display and enter date values.</p>
<p>This is now easily accomplished.</p>
<p>1. There is a new property called 'Date Format' in the 'Miscellaneous'  section on the 'Grid Properties' pane. The default for this property is  'MM/dd/yy', but you can select a different value. You can override this property  at runtime in Override Settings by setting the clientSideDateFormat property.  For example</p>
<p class="xbasic">tmpl.clientSideDateFormat = "dd/MM/yy"</p>
<p>You can also override this property at runtime by setting the special  session.<strong>protected</strong>clientSideDateFormat variable. This is the more likely  scenario as you can set this variable for each user when they log into your  application.</p>
<p>2. When you configure the date picker for date and time fields, you will  notice that the default value for the 'Format' property has been changed from  "mm/dd/yy" to "<Default>". This indicates that the date picker format will  be inherited from the global date format (set by the clientSideDateFormat  property discussed above).</p>
<p>3. When you select a date or time field in the Grid or Detail View part, a  default format is defined. The format is:</p>
<p class="xbasic">time("{grid.clientSideDateFormat}",<value>)</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;</p>
<p>{grid.clientSideDateFormat} is a special placeholder that gets replaced at  runtime with the value of the Grid's clientSideDateFormat property.</p>
<p>Assume that User1 logs on from New York. When User1 logs on, you set the  special session.<strong>protected</strong>clientSideDateFormat variable to "MM/dd/yy". All  dates in the Grid will appear in the MM/dd/yy format. When the user makes a  selection from the Date Picker, the date will be entered in the MM/dd/yy  format.</p>
<p>Assume that User2 logs on from London. When User2 logs on, you set the  special session.<strong>protected</strong>clientSideDateFormat variable to "dd/MM/yy". All  dates in the Grid will appear in the dd/MM/yy format. When the user makes a  selection from the Date Picker, the date will be entered in the dd/MM/yy  format.</p>
<p>When User1 or User2 submits data to the server, the date values are  automatically converted to the format required by the Regional Settings of the  machine on which the server is running.</p>
<p>This will all happen seamlessly, without requiring you to make any  modifications to your Grid component.</p>
<p>As a result of this change, the old 'Date format on server does not match  client' property in the Grid has been removed.</p>
<p><strong>Month and Day Names</strong> - You can customize the strings used for the month and  day names in the date picker.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ajaxvideotutorials.com/V10Videos/DatePickerCustomizeLanguage.swf">Watch  Video</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are outside the US, you will probably want to change the default  value for the Date Format to 'dd/MM/yy' for each new Grid that you build.</p>

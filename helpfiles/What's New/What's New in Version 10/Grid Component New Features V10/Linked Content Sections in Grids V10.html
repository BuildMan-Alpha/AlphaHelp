			<h2>Linked Content Sections</h2>
<p>Linked Content Sections allow you to display linked data in your Grid.</p>
<p>The linked content is displayed in a Tab or Accordion control if the Linked  Content Section links more than one object. Linked Content Sections essentially  duplicate the functionality of the Tabbed Grid Linker component and the Grid  Linker component (from V9 and prior version). But because Linked Content  Sections use Ajax, they don't have the performance penalty that Tabbed Grid  Linkers and Grid Linkers have. You can place as many Linked Content Sections  on&nbsp;your Grid as you want. For example, you might have a Customer Grid with a  Linked Content Section below the Grid that displays an Orders Grid (showing  orders for the selected Customer) and a Payments Grid (showing payments received  from the selected Customer). These two Grids would be displayed in a Tab or  Accordion control. Then, you might have another Grid (displayed, say, to the  right of the Customer Grid) showing a list of all documents/letters/proposals,  etc. that have been sent to the selected customer. NOTE: At present, you can  only place Grids in Linked Content Sections. We will add .a5w pages and other  web pages in the future.</p>
<p>The image below shows the Customer Grid with a Linked Content Section showing  the Orders Grid. This Grid, in-turn, has its own Linked Content Section which  shows the Order Details Grid.</p>

<h3>How to Place Linked Content In the Grid</h3>
<p>To place Lined Content into the Grid, check the 'Has linked Grids or other  content' checkbox and then click on the smart field. The following dialog is  displayed.</p>
<p>You can add add many Linked Content sections as you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>	<img src="images/LinkedContent.jpg" height="499" width="797" alt="Image" /></p>
<p>Click the 'Add Linked Content Section' button and give the section any  arbitrary name that you want.</p>
<p>	<img src="images/LinkedContent1.gif" height="88" width="499" alt="Image" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, click the 'Define Linked Content' button to define the linked  content.</p>
<p>	<img src="images/LinkedContent2.jpg" height="392" width="669" alt="Image" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have defined the linked content, you must then specify where on the  Grid the linked content should appear. You do this by placing a special  placeholder in one of the Grid's freeform edit regions.</p>
<p>To place the linked content, click the 'Edit Freeform Edit Region' button and  select which freeform edit region you want to use.</p>
<p>Then, insert the placeholder into the freeform html.</p>

<h3><b>Release notes<br />
</b></h3>
<p><b>Grid Component - Linked Content Sections - Master Template - </b>You can  now place Linked Content Sections in the Master Template. Previously, Linked  Content Sections could only be placed in a Free-form edit region. The benefit of  placing Linked Content Sections in the Master Template is that you get smoother  repainting of the Linked Content when the parent Grid is navigated, searched, or  sorted.</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p><b>HTML Memo Editor - Linked Content Section - Important Limitation - </b>If you  are displaying a Grid component in a Linked Content Section, and if the child  Grid contains a pop-up HTML memo editor, the Linked Content Grid must be placed  in the Master Template or a Search Part free-form edit region. The HTML editor  will not function correctly if the Linked Content is placed in the Grid part's  or Detail View part's free-form edit region.</p>

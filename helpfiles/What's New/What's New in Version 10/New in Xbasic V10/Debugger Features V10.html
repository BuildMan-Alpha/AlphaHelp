			<h2>Debugger Features</h2>
<p>The debugger has been completely rewritten. Many new features have been  added. It is now substantially faster and it will dramatically increase your  productivity when you are debugging your Xbasic code.</p>
<h3>Examine Variables</h3>
<p>You can now examine a variable in your script by simply hovering the mouse  over the variable. The window will go away when you click the mouse on the  debugger background. You can also drag this window into the Watch window to add  the variable to the Watch list. You can also double click on a variable to  quickly add it to the Watch window.</p>
<p>In this example, the mouse is hovering over 'p2'. The pop-up window can be  locked by clicking on the icon on the top right. You can edit values in the  running script by clicking on the pencil icon. You can navigate up and down in  dot variables by clicking on the 'bread crumbs' in the title bar.</p>
<p>	<img src="images/DebuggerPopupWatch.jpg" height="310" width="386" alt="Image" /></p>
<h3>Thread Window</h3>
<p>The Thread window allows debugging of background threads. The window displays  a list of running threads. Use this to debug scripts that use the  thread_create() function. You can hold the mouse over an entry in the Thread  Window to see the call stack for that thread.</p>
<!-- startAnchor --><a name="Stack Window"></a><!-- endAnchor -->
<h3>Stack Window</h3>
<p>Allows you to see the Xbasic stack (i.e. the list of prior functions that  have been called). You can hold you mouse over the icon to the left of each  entry to see the variables at that level of the stack.</p>
<p>This simplistic example shows a script that calls a function foo(), which  in-turn calls another function foo2(). We set a break point inside foo2() so the  Stack window shows foo() and foo2() on the stack.</p>
	<img src="images/DebuggerStackWindow.jpg" height="457" width="872" alt="Image" />
<h3>Watch Window</h3>
<ul>
    <li>allows inspection of property variables, arrays and collections.</li>
    <li>allows navigation around property variables and arrays. Includes 'return to  parent' button.</li>
    <li>has 'quick-delete' button on far left.</li>
    <li>persist watch variables from one debugging session to the next.</li>
    <li>save watch variables to a file and restore from a file (see top level Watch  menu command).</li>
</ul>
<p>This image shows how an array and a dot variable can be examined in the Watch  window. Notice that the array has been expanded to show all of the array  entries. The dot variable has also been expanded to show its properties. The  next image shows how these variables appear in the Watch window in their  collapsed state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>	<img src="images/DebuggerWatchWindowCollapsed.jpg" height="134" width="518" alt="Image" /></p>
<h3>Log Window</h3>
<p>You can log changes to a variable during the progression a script. To turn on  the feature, right click on a variable and select the 'Log change' menu  item.</p>
<p>	<img src="images/DebuggerLogVariablesMenu.jpg" height="102" width="311" alt="Image" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To open the Log Window, select the View menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>	<img src="images/DebuggerLogWindow.jpg" height="431" width="487" alt="Image" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that the top of the Log window is an outline of scripts, list of line  numbers&nbsp; and expressions to log. The log line can contain multiple expressions.  You simply need to separate the entries with a comma - e.g. "i,list" to log  changes in both the 'i' and 'list' variable on the given line,<br />
<br />
In the  lower pane, the currently logged values are shown. If the content is non-trivial  (i.e. bigger than 128 characters, including CR-LF characters, or if it is a  property variable) - then an external 'link' (a pencil icon) is provided to  inspect it. The link is to an external file in the log folder (which is inside  the temp folder).<br />
<br />
In the above example, clicking on the pencil icon for  the 'person' variable will bring up this window:<br />

<h3>Profiler</h3>
<p>You can now profile a section of code. Previously profiling was only  available by inserting profiler_begin()/profiler_end() Xbasic commands into your  code. You can now right click on any line of code and select the Begin Profiling  or End Profiling command.</p>
<p>To examine the profiling output, select the Profiling Window from the View  menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Real time comment-out</h3>
<p>You can now comment out certain lines of code in your script while you are  debugging by right clicking on a line and selecting the Comment out line  command. The debugger shows an icon next to the commented out line. In the  screenshot below, the debug(1) command has been commented out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<br />
	<img src="images/DebuggerCommentOut.jpg" height="176" width="403" alt="Image" /></p>
<h3>Edit Breakpoint Window</h3>
<p>You can now edit all breakpoints in your debugging environment from a single  window. You can also assign conditions to breakpoints. For example, the  screenshot below shows that the breakpoint on line 8 will trigger when the  variable, 'i' is equal to 8.</p>
<p>You can also disable breakpoints (rather than removing them entirely).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>	<img src="images/DebuggerBreakpoints.jpg" height="168" width="293" alt="Image" /></p>
<h3>Conditional Breakpoints and Global Breakpoints</h3>
<p>Conditional breakpoints allows you set a condition expression for a  breakpoint that you have set in your code, or for a global breakpoiont. The  breakpoint will only be triggered if the condition is true. To set a condition  for a breakpoint, right click on the breakpoint in the Script Window and select  the Edit Breakpoint command. This will open the Edit Breakpoint Window where you  can set a logical condition for the breakpoint. Notice that the icon for  conditional breakpoints changes to a red ball with a while plus sign in it.</p>
<p>A global breakpoint allows you to break the running script when an  expression's value changes, or when an expression is true. This is extremely  useful if you want to find out where a particular variable in your code is  getting changed, or set to a certain value, and you are not sure which line of  code is changing the variable.</p>
<p>To set a global breakpoint, open the Breakpoint Window, type an expression  into the Expression box and then click the Add Global Break button. If you want  to break when the expression changes value (as opposed to when a particular  condition is true), check the Break on Change box before you click the Add  Global Break button.</p>
<p>In the image shown below, you see two global breakpoints. The first entry  causes the running script to break when the value of the variable 'customerName'  changes. The second breakpoint causes the running script to break when the  expression 'city="Boston"' becomes true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>	<img src="images/DebuggerConditionalBreakPoints.jpg" height="404" width="522" alt="Image" /></p>
<h3>Configuring the Toolbar</h3>
<p>You can configure the buttons on the Debugger toolbar. To do this, select  View, Configure Toolbar command.</p>
<p>	<img src="images/DebuggerConfigureToolbar.jpg" height="373" width="540" alt="Image" /></p>
<h3>Debugger - Avoid Scrolling</h3>
<p>New option in the <strong>Debugger, Settings</strong> menu. Normally the debugger scrolls the code window to try to make the line with focus appear in the center of the code window. If you check this option, the debugger will not scroll the code in an attempt to center it.</p>
<h3>Debugger - 'Run to Line' Behavior</h3>
<p>In the prior builds, the 'Run to line' command set a temporary breakpoint, but allowed all other breakpoints, and the debug(1) command to cause a break before the specified line was reached.  Now Alpha Five also temporarily disables all breakpoints in the Xbasic code until the breakpoint is hit. So, for example, so if you right click on line 100 of a script and select 'Run to line', the debugger will actually execute to that line (unless an error is encountered), ignoring all the breakpoints you might have set between the current line in the script, and line you right-clicked on.</p>

			<h2>Performance</h2>
<p><b>Socket Performance</b> - Sockets used by the server are now read from and  written to more efficiently, allowing the actual transfer of data between client  and server to happen more quickly.</p>
<p><b>Optimized Request Parser</b> - The parser used to receive the incoming  request, validate it, and ensure that it is appropriately processed has been  optimized for performance to minimize server overhead.</p>
<p><b>Application Cache</b> - Application-specific information is now cached by  the server to make request processing more efficient. This includes the  application root, aliases, connection strings, and any variables created in  a5_application.a5i. Any changes to a5_application.a5i, such as updated aliases  or connection strings, now require the server to be restarted before taking  effect.</p>
<p><b>Gzip Caching</b> - Gzip is a compression technique used by many  application servers to reduce the amount of data that must be sent to a client.  This improves delivery speed of the response, but it adds some processing  overhead on the server as the compression takes place. To negate that overhead,  the server now caches gzipped copies of static content, eliminating the  processing required to duplicate the compression. This cache is automatically  cleared when the Application Server is shut down, or it can be cleared at any  time while the server is running by using Server.ClearGzipCache().</p>
The gzip caching in the V10 Application Server now monitors files and compares the originals to the cached gzipped copies. If the cached gzipped copy is found to be stale, it is removed from the cache.<br />
<br />
The monitoring of the gzip cache files is done in a background thread which sleeps for 2 seconds, then wakes up to verify the cache. It is possible, however, that because this thread runs at low priority that it could be starved for CPU on a busy server and the cache refresh may have a noticeable delay. This is unlikely to be an issue in a development environment which is where this feature is important.<br />
<p><b>More Responsive Server Shutdown</b> - General processing optimizations  allow the Application Server to be more responsive to shutdown requests.</p>

			<h2>Session Management</h2>
<p>A number of changes have been made to the session management mechanisms of  the Application Server to further enhance security and functionality.</p>
<p><b>Session Cookie Lifetime</b> - The cookie used to track session state is  now a "session" cookie. This means that it is never stored on the client's disk  and it will be removed when the client browser is closed.</p>
<p><b>Session Cookie is Http-Only</b> - The cookie used to track session state  is an Http-Only cookie. This protects the cookie from being accessed by  unauthorized scripts.</p>
<p><b>Session Cookie is "Secure"</b> - If SSL is in use by the server, the  cookie used to track session state is a Secure cookie. This ensures that the  cookie is only sent across an encrypted connection secured by SSL and never in  plain text.</p>
<p><b>Session IDs</b> - Session ID management and assignment have been made more  robust. Only session IDs that have been generated by the server are useable.  Additionally, session IDs cannot be recycled (reused). If the client attempts to  access a non-existent session, a new session ID will be assigned.</p>
<p><b>Session.BrowserId</b> - A new browser ID cookie provides an equivalent  long-lifetime browser identifier as the previous session ID did. This is similar  to older session IDs in that it does not change across sessions and can be used  to uniquely identify a client across sessions. The name and lifetime of this  cookie are configurable by the server administrator.</p>

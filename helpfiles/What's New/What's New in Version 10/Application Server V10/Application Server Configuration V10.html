			<h2>Server Configuration</h2>
<p><b>IP Address Binding</b> - The Application Server can now bind to a single  specific IP address instead of always binding to all addresses available on the  host machine. This allows multiple servers on the same system to use the same  port as long as they each use a different IP address. Running multiple servers  enables the hosting of distinct web sites or applications.</p>
<p><b>Header Read Timeout</b> - The period allowed for all request headers to be  received is now configurable by the server administrator. This was previously  hard-coded to 1.5 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Request Read Timeout</b> - The period allowed for the full request  (headers and body) to be received is now configurable by the server  administrator. This was previously hard-coded to 8 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Keep-Alive Timeout</b> - The period which the server waits on a previously  used connection to receive another request from the same client is now  configurable by server administrator. This was previously hard-coded to 15  seconds.</p>
<p><b>Maximum Keep-Alive Requests Per Connection</b> - The maximum allowed  requests per Keep-Alive connection before using a new connection is now  configurable by the server administrator. This was previously hard-coded to  100.</p>
<p><b>Maximum URI Length</b> - The maximum length of a URI that the server can  receive is now configurable by the server administrator. This was previously  hard-coded to 8192 bytes.</p>
<p><b>Disable Built-in Functionality</b> - Each of the following built-in server  features can be individually enabled or disabled. They are all enabled by  default.</p>
<ul>
    <li>.a5ajax processing</li>
    <li>.a5image processing</li>
    <li>Alpha favicon.ico</li>
    <li>Alpha JavaScript library</li>
    <li>Alpha Software logo</li>
    <li>automatic sample pages deployment</li>

			<h1><b><tbl>.delete_record() Method</b></h1>
Deletes a record from a table and honors field rules. For example, say you have defined a Posting field rule for the Quantity field in Invoice_items so that the corresponding QuantityOnHand field in the Products table was adjusted when the Quantity field in Invoice_Items was edited and also when a record in Invoice_Items was deleted. Previously, the 'Delete' posting rule would only work if the record was deleted using the Alpha Five user interface. It was not honored if the record was deleted using Xbasic. Now a new Xbasic method allows you to delete records and honor the 'Delete' posting rule. In Grid Components, when you delete a record, the Xbasic that is generated now uses the new <tbl>.delete_record() method.

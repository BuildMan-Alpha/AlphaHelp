			<h2>Check the firewall(s)</h2>
<p>Firewalls control network access to your server in order to provide a layer  of security from malicious attacks. In the process of blocking undesirable  access though, they can also block access to your server that you want to allow.  If your Application Server appears to start correctly but clients cannot connect  to it, it is quite likely that a firewall is blocking network access to your  Application Server.</p>
<p>Most versions of Windows include Windows Firewall, a built-in firewall to  control what incoming connections are allowed, and also which programs may  accept incoming connections and initiate outgoing connections. It is important  to be aware that Windows Firewall exceptions (connections which will be allowed)  can be set by the TCP port number, but also by the specific application. This  means that it is possible that you may have previously configured Windows  Firewall to allow an older version of the Application Server to function  properly, but a new version does not work as expected because it is a totally  different application with respect to Windows Firewall. In this case, you need  to add a new exception to the firewall rules.</p>
<p>In addition to Windows Firewall, many common security software packages, such  as McAfee Total Protection and Norton Internet Security, include a firewall for  additional protection. If you have software such as this installed, you should  review its accompanying documentation and ensure that it is not blocking access  to your Application Server.</p>
<p>In addition to software-based firewalls discussed above, many networks also  use hardware firewalls to restrict network access. These are dedicated devices  that provide similar access control to that of a software firewall, but across  an entire network instead of on a single PC. You should consult your network  administrator to find out if there is a hardware firewall in use and if it may  need to be specially configured for your Application Server.</p>

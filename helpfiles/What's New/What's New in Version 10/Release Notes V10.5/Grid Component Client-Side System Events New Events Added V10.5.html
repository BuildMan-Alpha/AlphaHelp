			<h3 class="showhide_heading" id="Grid_Component_-_Client-Side_System_Events_-_New_Events_Added">Grid Component - Client-Side System Events - New Events Added</h3>
These new client side system events have been added:<br />
<ul><li><strong>onRowSelect</strong> - fires when you click on a row. Fires for both updateable and read only Grids. Contrast with the existing onRowFocus event which only fires for updateable grids when a control gets focus.
</li><li><strong>onGridInitializeComplete</strong> - Fires when the Grid is first loaded after all of the HTML in the Grid has been rendered and after the Grid object has been initialized. Fires once. Does not fire after an AJAX callback.
</li><li><strong>BeforeAjaxCallback</strong> - called before any Ajax callback is made to the server. The 'e' object contains e.ajaxEvent - the name of the event that triggered the callback. This new event makes it easy to automatically put up a 'Wait...' message when any Ajax callback is taking place. You could easily add wait messages before, on a case by case basis. For example, you could have added wait messages to the canPageNavigate, canSort, etc. events, but now you can centralize all wait messages in a single event
</li><li><strong>OnGridRowCheck</strong> - fired when the user either checks or un-checks the checkbox in the Grid Checkbox column. The checkbox column appears optionally in the Grid if you turn it on by checking the 'Has checkbox select column' property. This event exposes these two properties in the 'e' object: rowNumber - the row number that was checked, and  checkboxValue - the value of the checkbox - either true or false.
</li><li><strong>afterImageUpload</strong> - this event fires after an image has been uploaded. (Requires Image Upload Feature Pack)
</li></ul><br />

			<h1 class="showhide_heading" id="Desktop_Applications_-_Counting_Number_of_Users_of_An_Application">Desktop Applications - Counting Number of Users of An Application</h1>
A Desktop Application can be in use by users of the full version of Alpha Five and the Runtime Version of Alpha Five. To get a count of the total number of users who are using the application you need to know how many Runtime users are using the application and how many Full Version users are using the application.<br />
<br />
The &lt;databaseName&gt;.muf file (in the same folder as the application database file - i.e. the .adb file) contains the number of users of the application who are using the Full Version<br />
The &lt;databaseName&gt;.rmuf file (in the same folder as the application database file - i.e. the .adb file) contains the number of users of the application who are using the Full Version<br />
<br />
The a5_registration_license_inuse() Function is used to read the .muf and .rmuf files. However, the Full Version of Alpha Five can only read the .muf file using this function. It cannot read the .rmuf file using this function.<br />
<br />
Similarly, using the a5_registration_license_inuse() Function, the Runtime Version can read the .rmuf file, but it cannot read the .muf file.<br />
<br />
To solve this problem (i.e. to allow the Full Version to read the .rmuf file, or the Runtime to read the .muf file) a new function is now available. The a5_registration_licenseEx_inuse() function allows Alpha Five to read an external .muf or .rmuf file.<br />
<br />
To use the a5_registration_licenseEx_inuse() function, you must pass in the license number of the Alpha Five executable that 'owns' the .muf or .rmuf file you want to read, as well as the filename of the .muf or .rmuf file.<br />
<br />
For example, if your code is being run in the Full Version of Alpha Five you would need to pass in the license number of the Runtime Version, and vice versa.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
(Assume that this code is being run from the Full Version of Alpha Five)<br />
<br />
<div class="plugincode" ><pre class="codelisting" data-syntax="" dir="ltr" style="overflow:auto;" id="codebox" >? a5_registration_license_inuse("C:\Data\AlphaSports.muf")
= 3
 
 
'No users because the .rmuf is not 'owned' by the Full version
? a5_registration_license_inuse("C:\Data\AlphaSports.rmuf")
= 0
 
? a5_registration_licenseEx_inuse("C:\Data\AlphaSports.rmuf","123453334332")
= 5</pre></div><br />

A change has been made to web security. The security for a project is identified by a special value saved in a file named 'Guid.SecuritySettings'. Previously, this was a physical file in the web project and every publish profile for the project used the same identifier. If the contents of a project was copied to another project folder or published to multiple locations, the file had to be deleted to prevent conflicts.<br />
<br />
The new process ties the security identifier to the publish profile and not the project. Each publish profile will use its own guid value. With the change, there won't be a physical 'guid.SecuritySettings' file in the project. Publishing will create a new file in with the unique identifier in the target folder specified by the profile as needed. If you publish a project created prior to this build, the process will delete any existing 'guid.SecuritySettings' file as it is no longer used and add a new identifier to the profile automatically. Changing the target folder in a publish profile will also create a new security identifier when any item is published using that profile.<br />
<br />
With the change, you will be able to publish two copies of the same project to the same server with two different publish profiles, as long as each is in a separate folder under the webroot. You still won't be able to publish one instance to the webroot, and another to a folder <em>under</em> the webroot as the one in the subfolder will use the security of the one in the higher level webroot. But if each is in a separate folder under the webroot, they will now work correctly.<br />

The Application Server adds new functionality to work-around a bug in Microsoft Internet Explorer which breaks the display of PDFs. The cause of these PDF display problems is a well-documented race condition in IE, going back to at least IE 4.0. (There is a lot of discussion on Adobe's Message Boards concerning this issue.)<br />
<br />
Just to be clear: This is NOT an Alpha Five bug.<br />
<br />
Up until now, the only work-around for this Adobe/Microsoft bug has been to globally turn off gzip compression at the server level. However, this has the negative side effect of decreasing overall application performance - particularly on a slower network such as those used by mobile devices.<br />
<br />
Now, the Application Server will specifically recognize that a PDF has been requested from an IE client, and not compress the output in only this very specific case. If a PDF is requested from any other browser software, the output will still be gzipped since all other browsers properly handle the compressed PDF response.<br />
<br />
The Alpha Application Server bypasses the IE bug that is breaking PDF files for some users without impacting the overall server performance as would be done if gzip were to be globally turned off or even turned off for a single file type (PDF) across all browsers. As a result, the Application Server mitigates a bug in Microsoft's code for Internet Explorer with an absolute minimum of impact for non-buggy client software. This goes well beyond the functionality of other servers (such as IIS or Apache) which do not target specific browsers with their gzip compression functionality and thereby reduce performance for all clients because of an IE-specific bug.<br />

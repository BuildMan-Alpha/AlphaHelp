		<td><p>Grids have a property called 'Alternate Views'. An Alternate View is simply
another way of displaying the data in the Grid. You can define custom Alternate
View (using Xbasic), or you can use one of the built-in Alternate Views. The
most commonly used built-in Alternate View is a Google Map. This is used to plot
the data displayed in the Grid as markers on a Google Map. The following videos
show how you can use the Google Map Alternate View in a Grid.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>This video show:</p>
		<p>1) Defining an Alternate View with a Google Map and showing a marker	on the map for each record in the Grid.<br>
</p>
		<p>2) Defining the bubble help for each marker on the Grid so that it
		shows data from the corresponding record in the Grid.</p>

		small window that pops up when the user clicks on a marker.
		<p></p>
		<p>The video shows how you can put any HTML that you want in the info box
		and how the html can include placeholders to include data from the
		corresponding row in the Grid. The HTML can also include Javascript
		commands. In the video we show how you can insert the Javascript to open	the corresponding Detail View part for the current record.</p>

		example, if record 1 in the Grid was for a customer with a low credit
		rating, the corresponding icon on the map might be red. If record 2 was	for a customer with a high credit rating, the corresponding icon on the
		map might be green.<p></p>
		<p>In the video we have a Grid based on our sample Airports table and we	show how a different map icon is used depending on the elevation of each
		airport shown in the Grid. </p>
		<p></p>
		<p>The video also discusses the different ways in which the Alternate
		Views can be shown on the Grid. Alternate Views can be shown in Tabs, or they can be shown on the main page, alongside the main Grid.</p>

		<p>In the video, we show the map, with a marker for each row in the
		Grid. The Grid itself is hidden. However, when the user clicks on a

		icon, bubble help and info box text. You can also draw a circle around
		the marker and you can control the color of the circle and the shading
		of the interior of the circle. The circle and its color can be used to
		convey information about the corresponding record in the Grid.<p></p>
		<p>The ability to draw a circle around the marker could be used to
		indicate the service area of a branch location. Or it might be used to
		represent the relative price of a house in a real estate application.
		For example,for more expensive houses you might draw a larger circle
		around the marker on the map.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>In this video, which shows a Grid based on the sample Airports
		database, we draw a circle around each marker on the map. The radius of	the circle is proportional to the airport's elevation.</p>

		the icon name to use for the marker. Or, you can specify an Xbasic
		function that will get called for each row in the Grid. The function can	compute the marker icon based on the data in the current Grid row.<p></p>
		<p>You can also use built in image sequences. An image sequence is a set	of numbered icons. </p>
		<p></p>
		<p>In this video we show how you can use an image sequence in the map
		and also use the same sequence in the Grid itself. This makes it very easy
		for the user to see a record in the Grid and immediately locate the
		corresponding marker on the map.</p>

		<td>When you place a marker on a Google Map you can assign the marker a	logical 'layer' name. For example the layer name for a marker could be
		'High Risk', or 'Medium Risk', etc. Then using the automation features
		on the map that Alpha exposes, you can hide and show different layers on		the map. For example, you might put a checkbox control on your Grid with		these entries: High risk, Medium risk and Low risk. Then when the user
		checked or unchecked an entry, your Javascript automation code could
		hide or show the markers in the corresponding map layer.<p></p>
		<p>In this video we show how we have defined a map with 3 logical layers=

		- 'layer1', 'layer2' and 'layer3'. When each marker is placed on the map
		is is assigned to one of these layers. In the example, the rule
		for assigning a marker to a particular layer is contrived - if the
		marker is for a record in the first 3 rows of the Grid, it is in
		'level1', and so on. Obviously, in a real application you would have	more realistic rules for assigning markers to different map layers.
		Then, we put a checkbox control in a free-form
		region of the grid to control which layers as shown. We also show how
		the markers in a particular layer can be animated to draw attention to
		them.</p>

In this application, we don't want to display this prompt or show the 'Set' button because we have hard-coded the search to use a 10 mile radius. However, we can't simply leave the prompt out of the toolbar because then the search will fail. That's because when the search is executed the radius of the search area needs to be submitted to the server and if the radius field is not in the Search Part, no radius value is submitted. Therefore we MUST include the <span style="color:blue; background:">{toolbar.setRadius}</span> placeholder, but we can hide it, which we do by wrapping it in <span style="color:blue; background:">&lt;span&gt;</span> tags and setting the style on the <span style="color:blue; background:">&lt;span&gt;</span> to <span style="color:blue; background:">display:none</span>.<br />

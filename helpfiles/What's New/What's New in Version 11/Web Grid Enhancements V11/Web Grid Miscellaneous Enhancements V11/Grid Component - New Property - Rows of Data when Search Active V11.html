			<h1 class="showhide_heading" id="Grid_Component_-_New_Property_-_Rows_of_Data_when_Search_Active">Grid Component - New Property - Rows of Data when Search Active</h1>
This property allows you to display a different number of records per page when a search (performed using the Grid's Search Part) is active. Normally, there would be little need to show a different number of records per page when a search is active and when a search is not active. However if you have defined Alternate Views for the Grid it might be important.<br />
<br />
Consider the following scenario. Say you have a Grid showing houses for sale. You have also defined Alternate View showing a Google Map with a marker for each house for sale.<br />
<br />
<div class="simplebox">Remember, the Alternate View is an Alternate View of the <em>records displayed in the Grid</em> (not an Alternate View of all the records in the Grid query)</div><br />
Let's assume that that the Grid is set to show 10 records per page and you enter search criteria to find houses for sale in a certain area. Let's assume further that when you run the search, there are 15 records that meet your search criteria. If the number of records per page when a search is active is set to its default value, your Grid will show the first 10 houses for sale (and you will need to navigate to page 2 of the Grid to see the remaining 5 houses). Your Alternate View will show a map with 10 markers on it (because there are 10 rows of data in the Grid). However, you really want the map to show markers for all of the houses that meet your search criteria. You can solve this problem by setting the 'Rows of Data when Search Active' to 0. When you run the abovementioned search, your Grid will show all of the records in the query (15 in the above example), and your Alternate View will show a map with 15 markers on it.<br />
<br />
Note: When you set the 'Rows of Data when Search Active' property to 0, the actual number of records shown on the page is still subject to the setting for the 'Maximum Number of Records Per Page' property.<br />

			<h1 class="showhide_heading" id="Grid_and_Dialog_Component_-_Edit-Combo_Control_-_Filter_Method_for_Required_Selection_property">Grid and Dialog Component - Edit-Combo Control - Filter Method for Required Selection property</h1>
A new property has been added to the edit-combo control. The 'Filter method for required selection' property is shown when the 'User must select from list' property is checked.<br />
<br />
The choices for this new property are: 'FirstLetter' and 'Progressive'.<br />
<br />
Before this property was added, the behavior was equivalent to 'FirstLetter' . This meant that once the user opened the edit-combo and displayed the list of choices, typing a character would move to the first entry in the list that started with that character. Typing the same character a second time would move the the next entry in the list that started with that character. So, for example, if the user typed a 'd' after opening the list of choices, focus would move to the first entry that started with 'd'. If the user then typed an 'a', focus would move the first entry that started with 'a'.<br />
<br />
However, if the 'Progressive' option is chosen, the list of choices is progressively filtered as the user type characters.<br />

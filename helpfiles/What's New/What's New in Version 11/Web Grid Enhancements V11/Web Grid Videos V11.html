		default values for fields in new records. This can be done by either 

		specifying the field's 'Initial Value' property, or by specifying code 

		in the 'onInitialValueCalculate' event.<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>In the case where data entry is done in the Grid Part (as opposed to 

		the Detail View), the issue with the 'onInitialValueCalculate' event 

		(which is a server-side event), is that it is only called once, when the 

		Grid is initially rendered. So, if you enter a new record and then save 

		that record, the event is not called before the next new record is 

		displayed. This video shows how you can save the value of a field that 

		was just entered inside the Grid's 'stateInfo' object, and then use the 

		'afterRowPopulate' event to retrieve that value and use it as a default 

		in the next new record.</p>

		<p>Note: The .setValue() method is not used to set the value of the 

		field in the new record row because this would cause the new record row 

		to go 'dirty'. Instead we get a pointer to the element and then simply 

		set its value property.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>For example, when you save search criteria from the Search Part of a

		component. This is important because when you load a saved search, you 

		only want the user to see the saved searches that 'belong' to the 

		current component. If you want to manage the records in the Repository, 

		(by creating a Grid that is based on the Repository table), you might 

		want to filter the records in the Repository based on the Guid of a 

		particular component. </p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Say you have a Grid called 'Customers' and you want to put a button 

		on this Grid to show the Repository entries that belong to this Grid.

		<td>&nbsp;<p>V11 Introduces the concept of 'Abstract CSS Class Names'. 

		When you design a Component, all of the HTML is now marked up using 

		abstract CSS class names (e.g. <a class="wiki"  href="class.gridPartSelect" rel="">class.gridPartSelect</a>). A class map 

		defines how the abstract CSS class name maps to the physical class names 

		in your CSS stylesheets. </p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>This is a very powerful concept because it gives you very granular 

		control over the styling of different elements in your components. These 

		videos explain the concept in more detail.</p>

		of a Javascript Function</td>

		<td>(This video is aimed at advanced developers). When you use Action 

		Javascript to open a Grid, Report, Dialog, Custom Component, etc. you 

		often need to bind the value of an argument to a value from the parent 

		Component. For example, you might bind the value of 'arg1' to the value 

		of the Lastname field in the current Grid row.<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Now, instead of binding an argument to the value of a field in the 

		Grid, you can specify an arbitrary Javascript function to execute. The 

		argument is bound to the value that this Javascript function returns.</p>

		show/hide event fires, you can now define your own Javascript function 

		that will get called.

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>This video shows an interesting use of this functionality. In the 

		video, we show a Grid with a Detail View. In the Detail View, a large 

		number of fields are hidden by show/hide client-side events. The space 

		taken up by the hidden controls is not completely eliminated because the 

		controls are contained in rows (&lttr> tags) that are not hidden. We use 

		the Javascript function to hide the empty &lttr> tags.</p>

Data in a Grid can be filtered based on the current logged in user.  

This video shows how to set a filter in a Grid so that only data for the current

logged in user is shown. 

<p>

The Grid filter uses an argument whose value is set to a session variable.

This session variable is populated when the page that contains the Login Component runs

when the user logs in initially.

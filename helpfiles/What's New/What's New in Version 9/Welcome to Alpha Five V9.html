			<h1>Welcome to Alpha Five V9 </h1>
<h2>Welcome to Alpha Five V9. </h2>
<p>This new version of Alpha Five offers something for users of every skill 
level. There are a lot of very exciting new features in this release that make 
Alpha Five both easier to use and much more powerful.</p>
<p>A signature feature of this release is 'active-link' tables, which now allow 
you to build enterprise class applications against SQL databases. Even if you 
don't use SQL databases, you will still find lot's of exciting new features in 
V9.</p>
<p>This document describes all of the new features in Version 9. We hope you 
enjoy reviewing it as much as we have enjoyed creating V9!</p>
<p>Many of the descriptions of the new features are accompanied by video 
demonstrations. For a quick overview of what's new, we suggest that you start on

<p>V9 is available in two editions, 'Platinum' and 'Standard'. The 'Standard' 
edition includes all of the features of the 'Platinum' edition with the

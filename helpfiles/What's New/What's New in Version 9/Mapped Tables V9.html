			<h1>Mapped Tables</h1>



<p>Alpha Five now allows you to create 'mapped' tables. A mapped table is a 
virtual table that displays data from one or more physical tables. The mapped 
table can include all, or a subset of, the field fields in the physical tables 
that it maps. It can also include calculated columns. Once you have created a 
mapped table, it appears in the Tables tab of the Control Panel just like any 
other table. You can create Forms, Reports, Labels, Letters and Operations for 
mapped tables just as you would for physical tables. Mapped tables can be 
read-only, or updateable, depending on how they are defined.</p>
<p>Here are some ways in which a mapped table can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to define an Export Operation and include a calculation in your 
export definition. For example, your table has a Quantity and Price field, 
and you want to export these fields, as well as a Total field (Quantity * 
Price). The Export Operation builder does not allow you to define 
calculations. To solve this problem, you create a mapped table that has the 
Quantity, and Price fields, as well as a new calculated field called Total. 
You can then define your Export Operation on this new mapped table.</li>
<li>You want to include data from multiple tables in a Table Lookup Field 
Rule. The Field Rule editor only allows you to select Tables (not Sets) as 
the data source for a Lookup Field Rule. To solve this problem, you define a 
mapped table that joins all of the tables that you would like to use in the 
Lookup Field Rule, and then when you define the Field Rule, you specify the 
mapped table as the lookup data source.</li>
<li>You have a complicated Xbasic script that operates against a certain table. 
Your script makes certain assumptions about the fieldnames in the table. You 
would like to run this script against another table that has the same fields, 
but with different names. To solve this problem, you create an updateable mapped 
table that makes the table 'look' as if it has the same structure as the 
original table that your script was designed to operate against. You then run 
your script against the mapped table.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a new Mapped Table, either right click on white space in the 
Control Panel when the Tables/Sets tab is active, or click on the New button and 
select 'New Mapped Table...' from the menu.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/newina10.jpg"></p>
<p>The 'Mapped Table' editor is displayed as shown below (showing the definition 
for a Mapped table that displays information from the invoice_header and 
customer tables).</p>
<p>This dialog has two tabs. The 'Tables' tab allows you to select which tables 
are included in the mapped table. You can select one or more tables. For each 
table, other than the first table, you must specify how that table is related to 
its parent. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/newina11.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that all joins in Mapped tables are one-to-one. In the event that a 
parent record is related to multiple child records, you can select if the match 
is the first matching record, last matching record or closest matching record.</p>
<p>The 'Fields' tab allows you to select the fields, and calculated fields, that appear in the mapped 
table.</p>
<p>You can select fields from the 'Available Fields' list on the left and then 
click the Select button. You can also select fields by double clicking them.</p>
<p>Once a field has been selected, you can edit its display expression. For 
example, say you wanted a single field called 'fullname', rather than two fields 
(firstname and lastname). You could select the 'firstname' field and then edit 
the properties of this field, changing its name from 'firstname' to 'fullname' 
and its display expression to: alltrim(customer->firstname) + " " + 
alltrim(customer->lastname).</p>
<p>The 'Fields' tab has two views, The 'Editor View' is shown below. This view 
allows you to edit the field list in the Mapped table using the guided builder. 
The 'Xbasic View' (shown in the subsequent screenshot), allows you to edit the 
field list in a freeform manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/newina15.jpg"></p>
<p>The Xbasic View shows a text area in which you can edit the field list for 
the mapped table. To see the syntax for the Xbasic View, click the 'Show syntax' 
hyperlink.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/newina16.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mapped Table definition shown above is read-only because it only defines 
how data is mapped <b>from</b> the source tables to the mapped table. In order 
to make any field in the mapped table updatable, you have to also define the 
reverse map, which specifies how data is mapped from the mapped table <b>back</b> 
to the source tables. If a mapped table joins multiple tables, only the fields 
in the primary table are updateable.</p>
<p>For example, the Mapped Table definition above has a field called 'SalesDate' with 
a display expression of 'Date'.</p>
<p>To make this an updateable field, the definition would be changed as follows:</p>
<p class="xbasic">SalesDate,D,8,0=Date</p>
<p class="xbasic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date=SalesDate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This definition is interpreted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mapped table has a field called 'SalesDate'. This field is populated 
with the 'Date' field from the Invoice_header table (because the display 
expression is not qualified with a table alias, the expression is assumed to 
refer to fields in the primary table of the Mapped table definition)</li>
<li>When edits are made to the 'SalesDate' field in the Mapped Table, the 
changes are written back to the 'Date' field in the Invoice_header table.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any changes that you make while editing in the 'Xbasic View' are parsed when 
you switch back to the 'Editor View' and the builder is updated to reflect your 
changes.</p>
<p>At any time while editing the Mapped Table, you can click the 'Preview mapped 
table' button to see how your table will look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/newina17.jpg"></p>
<p>Once you have saved your Mapped Table, you can always go back and edit its 
definition.</p>
<p>To edit a previously created Mapped Table, right click on the table in the 
Control Panel and select Mapped Table, Edit Mapped Table Definition from the 
menu. The Mapped Table builder will be reopened.</p>

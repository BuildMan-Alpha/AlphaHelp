            </td>
            <td valign="top">After you have created a PhoneGap application from a UX component, if you subsequently want to update the application
                you need to go through the entire release cycle again (i.e. submit to PhoneGap Build, then submit to the
                appropriate App Store). However, if you enable the Instant Update feature when you build your application
                in the first place, you can make certain types of updates to your application without having to go through
                the release cycle again.
                <br>
                <br>Instant Update can be used as long as you are not changing the PhoneGap plugins used by your application,
                or the splash screens, etc. You can perform an Instant Update on an application as long as the changes to
                the application are limited to changes in the application's UX component.
                <br>
                <br>In this video we show how the Instant Update feature operates.

            <td valign="top">Adding Bubble Help with Record Counts to Buttons in Alphabet Button Search Bar</td>
            <td valign="top">The Alphabet Button search bar in a grid is a convenient way for searching for all records where a field starts
                with a particular letter. It can be useful for the user to know how many records are in each group before
                they actually press the button to execute the query.
                <br>
                <br>In this video we show how bubble help is added to each button in the Alphabet button search bar. When the
                user hovers the mouse over the button, the bubble help shows how many records are in the group.

                it might be desirable to use a date picker that is more tuned to a mobile application, such as a control
                that uses Spin Lists to select the month, day and year.

                <br>

                can also be implemented using a disclosure (which is a much simply solution).
                <br>
                <br>In this video we show how the disclose menu can be made to scroll.

            <td valign="top">Defining the Encoding for the Body Data</td>
            <td valign="top">A common use case for an API is to create a new record in a database or to update an existing record in a database.
                In these cases, the request will typically be a POST and the data for the new or updated record will be in
                the request body. The data in the body can either be FORM or JSON encoded.

            <td valign="top">In this video we show how to create a REST API that returns complex JSON data for a customer. The API will return
                data about a particular customer, including all of the orders placed by that customer, and for each order,
                all of the line items in that order. The data will come from querying the sample Northwind database. The
                video shows an example of the type of complex data that a REST API is often designed to return.

            <td valign="top">When you create a REST API you can either start by defining an Xbasic Class that defines the methods you want
                to expose in your API, or you can start by importing a Swagger definition for the API. Swagger is an open
                source standard for describing REST APIs. When you import a Swagger API definition, Alpha Anywhere will create
                a stub Xbasic class that you can then edit.
                <br>
                <br>In this video we show how you can import a Swagger definition.

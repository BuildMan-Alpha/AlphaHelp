    <h1>Alpha Anywhere 4.5.4 - Key Benefits</h1>
    <p>This release of Alpha Anywhere includes features in Security and for the Application Server for IIS. It also includes several bug fixes.</p>
    <p>Alpha Anywhere 4.5.4 was released 10 days after <a href="https://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/index?search=aav4_5_3%20overview">Alpha Anywhere 4.5.3</a> and builds on the security and data integration functionality introduced with the release of Alpha Anywhere 4.5.3.</p>
    <h2>Security Features</h2>
    <p>Alpha Anywhere already has a robust <a href="https://www.alphasoftware.com/mobile-app-development/application-security">security framework</a> but this new version increases security for your business apps. This version offers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="padding-bottom:15px;">Audit Logging<strong></strong> - Take the guesswork out of who updated records with Auditing. Easily track changes made to your SQL data source including who edited your data, when the data was changed, and what value were modified. See <a href="https://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/index?search=server%20ref%20web%20project%20settings#section1_Audit%20table%20(for%20SQL%20tables)">Audit table (for SQL tables)</a> to learn more.</li>

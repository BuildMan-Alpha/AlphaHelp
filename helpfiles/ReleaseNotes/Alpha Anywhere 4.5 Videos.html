                Normally, UX components can be localized by
                wrapping the strings you want to translate in
                either language tags (&lt;a5:r&gt;...&lt;/a5:r&gt;) or text
                dictionary tags (&lt;a5:t&gt;...&lt;/a5:t&gt;). The string
                translation takes place on the server when the
                component is rendered. But in a PhoneGap
                application, the component is loaded from the
                file system on the device and so you can&#39;t use
                language or text dictionary tags. Instead, you
                must use a client-side approach (using
                Javascript) to translate the strings into the
                selected language.<br>
                <br>
                In this video we show how you can implement
                client-side language translation.<br>

                that Reference External Data</td>
            <td valign="top">
                Typically, the client-side show/hide and enable
                expressions in a FormView layout reference field
                values that are in the data being displayed in
                the Form. For example, the Form might have a
                field called Country and you might want to show
                a container only when the Country field has a
                certain value. <br>
                <br>
                However, there are also use cases where you want
                to reference external data (i.e. the value in
                some other control on the UX) in a client-side
                expression. This video shows how this is done
                using FormView state variables.<br>

                External Data</td>
            <td valign="top">
                When you define the layout for a ViewBox
                control, the template can use the
                <font color="#0000FF" face="Courier New">{*if}</font>
                directive to conditionally show/hide content in
                the ViewBox. Typically the expression in the<font color="#0000FF" face="Courier New">
                    {*if}</font> directive will reference data in
                the ViewBox data. But in some cases you might
                want to reference data that is external to the
                ViewBox (for example, your UX might have a
                control whose value you want to reference in the
                <font color="#0000FF" face="Courier New">{*if}</font>
                directive&#39;s conditional expression). In order to
                do this, you must create a ViewBox state
                variable that is set to the value of the
                external data. <br>
                <br>
                In this video we show how external data is used

                Many applications allow you to rate something by
                tapping on a star in a StarRating control. The
                UX component has a stand-alone StarRating
                control (accessed by selecting
                <font color="#0000FF" face="Courier New">
                    [More...] </font>in the UX Builder Controls

                A common user interface pattern seen in mobile
                apps that use a List is to allow the user to
                drag on a row in the List to invoke some type of
                action. For example in the iOS Email app a user
                can drag on a row to archive the row, mark is as
                unread/read, or move the row to another folder.<br>

            <td valign="top">
                In certain applications where a List control is
                used, it is necessary to allow the user to
                reorder the rows in the List. A common user
                interface pattern used to reorder List rows is
                to allow the user to drag a row to its new
                position in the List. <br>

                Keyboard shortcuts can speed up a user&#39;s
                interaction with a component. For example, you
                could configure the Ctrl-S key as a shortcut for

                Reorder List Rows by Dragging Row to a new Group when Client-side Grouping is Enabled</td>
            <td valign="top">
                When client-side grouping is enabled in a List, the order of the rows in the List is determined by the sort expression that
                is applied to the data so that the List data can be grouped correctly. That means that if you drag a row
                to a new position, and then drop, the row will immediately snap back to its original position (because the
                client-side sort will be re-applied to the List data).
                <br>
                <br> However, you might want to use drag reorder to move a row from one group to another. This is done by changing
                data in the row that is moved so that in the
                <font color="#0000FF" face="Courier New">
                    onMoveEnd</font> event, the data in the row is updated and then, when the client-side sort is applied
                to the List data, the row will continue to appear in the target group.
                <br>
                <br>In this video we show how a list of customers, grouped by Country, can be re-arranged by dragging a customer

                The Auto-suggest and Edit Combo controls have always allowed you to set a mode where multiple selections can be made. However,
                each time you make a selection the pick list is closed and you must reopen the pick list before you can make
                your next selection.

                <br> Now, a new property in these controls allows you to specify that the pick list should stay open after each

                The ControlBar is highly configurable. This allows you to create solutions for many different use cases. There are several
                common patterns that developers use and for many of these patterns you can get a quick start by selecting
                one of the pre-defined ControlBar templates. For example, common patterns addressed by the pre-defined templates
                are:ControlBar with a menu button that animates in a menu from the left or right side of the Panel, ControlBar
                with buttons that reveal animated drop-down menus, ControlBar with buttons that allow you to create a tabbed
                user interface.
                <br>
                <br> In this video we show how you can create a new ControlBar from a template and then continue to modify the

                you need to go through the entire release cycle again (i.e. submit to PhoneGap Build, then submit to the
                appropriate App Store). However, if you enable the Instant Update feature when you build your application
                in the first place, you can make certain types of updates to your application without having to go through
                the release cycle again.
                <br>
                <br>Instant Update can be used as long as you are not changing the PhoneGap plugins used by your application,
                or the splash screens, etc. You can perform an Instant Update on an application as long as the changes to
                the application are limited to changes in the application's UX component.

                with a particular letter. It can be useful for the user to know how many records are in each group before
                they actually press the button to execute the query.
                <br>
                <br>In this video we show how bubble help is added to each button in the Alphabet button search bar. When the
                user hovers the mouse over the button, the bubble help shows how many records are in the group.

                Cascading dropdown boxes allow you to dynamically change the choices in a child dropdown box based on the selection in the
                parent dropdownbox. The UX component makes it very easy to define cascading dropdownboxes. However, in applications
                that are designed to work offline, you cannot use the standard way of creating cascading dropdownboxes because
                if you are offline you cannot make the Ajax callback to populate the child dropdownboxes when the parent
                dropdownbox value is changed. However, you can still implement cascading dropdown boxes in offline applications
                by populating the dropdownboxes from data in the client-side data cache.

                user. The GMail web application, and also the

            <td valign="top">When you build multi-tenant SASS applications that use a

                tenant id field and all of your SQL queries must include the
                tenent Id. When you use a multi-tenant connection string,
                the tenant id is automatically injected into all SQL
                statements before the statement is sent to the database.
                This makes it easier to build multi-tenant SASS
                applications, or to convert an existing application to a
                multi-tenant application because you do not have to manually
                adjust all of your SQL statements.<br>

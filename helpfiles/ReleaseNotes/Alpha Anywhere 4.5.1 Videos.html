                Reorder List Rows by Dragging Row to a new Group when Client-side Grouping is Enabled</td>
            <td valign="top">
                When client-side grouping is enabled in a List, the order of the rows in the List is determined by the sort expression that
                is applied to the data so that the List data can be grouped correctly. That means that if you drag a row
                to a new position, and then drop, the row will immediately snap back to its original position (because the
                client-side sort will be re-applied to the List data).
                <br>
                <br> However, you might want to use drag reorder to move a row from one group to another. This is done by changing
                data in the row that is moved so that in the
                <font color="#0000FF" face="Courier New">
                    onMoveEnd</font> event, the data in the row is updated and then, when the client-side sort is applied
                to the List data, the row will continue to appear in the target group.
                <br>
                <br>In this video we show how a list of customers, grouped by Country, can be re-arranged by dragging a customer
                from one country to another.

                Using the Spreadsheet Input Control</td>
            <td valign="top">
                In certain applications where a user needs to input data quickly, a spreadsheet style data entry control can be very efficient.
                <br>
                <br> In this video we show how you can add a Spreadsheet Input control to a UX component.

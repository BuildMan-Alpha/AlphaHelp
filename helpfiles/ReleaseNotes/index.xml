            <description>
                <p>In addition to the official updates that Alpha Software makes available from time to time (which are described in this document), we also make available our internal nightly builds that allow you to see what features have been added and what bugs have been fixed since the last official update. The features and bug fixes in the nightly build will be part of the next official update.</p>

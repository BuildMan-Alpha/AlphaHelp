            <td valign="top">
                Cascading dropdown boxes allow you to dynamically change the choices in a child dropdown box based on the selection in the
                parent dropdownbox. The UX component makes it very easy to define cascading dropdownboxes. However, in applications
                that are designed to work offline, you cannot use the standard way of creating cascading dropdownboxes because
                if you are offline you cannot make the Ajax callback to populate the child dropdownboxes when the parent
                dropdownbox value is changed. However, you can still implement cascading dropdown boxes in offline applications
                by populating the dropdownboxes from data in the client-side data cache.
                <br>
                <br>In this video we show how data in the client-side data cache is used to create cascading dropdownboxes.

            <td valign="top">A common requirement in mapping applications is to compute a route (showing driving directions, distance and
                travel time) between points.
                <br>
                <br>In this video we show how a route, defined by addresses in a List control is used to compute driving directions,
                distance and travel times between points on the route. The code is all generated automatically by Action
                Javascript.

            <td valign="top">You can easily consume SOAP services from your Xbasic code. But it can be difficult to find publicly available
                SOAP services to test your code with. Using the sample WCF SOAP service that ships with Alpha Anywhere, you
                can easily create test code that shows how to consume methods in a SOAP service.
                <br>
                <br> In this video we show how the sample WCF service can be used.

                </td>
                <td valign="top">
                    A common requirement when using the FormView control is capturing a signature. Alpha Anywhere has a Signature control, but
                    this control captures signatures as bitmaps and is not ideal for use in a FormView control. The Ink control
                    is better suited for this use case.
                    <br>
                    <br> In this video we show how a FormView control is configured to use the built-in SignatureInk editor.

                    The Xbasic code you write in your Web applications can call methods in Node.js modules that are installed from NPM (the Node
                    Package Manager).
                    <br>
                    <br> In this video we show how a Node module is installed into the Web Project folder and then how a Node
                    Service is created so that methods in the Node module can be called.
                    <br>
                    <br> The particular Node module that we install in this video is called Tinify and we show how a Node Service
                    is defined so that we can call into this module from Xbasic using the Node_request() function.

                    You can customize the appearance of the 'overlay' and add your own tools (i.e buttons).

                    Setting the background image in the Ink Control is a common practice. In this video we discuss various aspects of how you
                    can set the Ink control image background and control whether the UX goes dirty when the Ink background
                    is set.

                    Using the Ink Control to Capture Signatures</td>
                <td valign="top">
                    The UX Component has always had a built in Signature Capture control. However, it is also possible to use the Ink control
                    to capture signatures. The primary benefit of using the Ink control to capture signatures is that the
                    signature is captured using the Ink format, which is an ascii format, rather than as a PNG image, which
                    the Signature Capture control uses.
                    <br>
                    <br> In this video we show how to configure the Ink control to capture signatures.

                    Using a ViewBox as the List's Detail View</td>
                <td valign="top">
                    A common pattern when building mobile applications is to use a List control with a Detail View. When the user taps on a row
                    in the List, the Detail View shows the details for the selected row. This pattern is used extensively,
                    especially for offline applications where the data in the List is intended to be updateable.
                    <br>
                    <br> However, there are many cases where the List is not intended to be&nbsp; updateable and a much 'lighter
                    weight' solution can be achieved but
                    <b>
                        not</b> turning on the List's 'Has Detail View property' and instead, using a ViewBox to display
                    details for the selected row in the List.
                    <br>
                    <br> An even lighter weight solution can be achieved by using a ViewBox to replace the List. So you end up
                    with a ViewBox to display a list of records and another ViewBox to display details for the selected record.

                    Building a Custom Image Gallery using the List and Ink Control</td>
                <td valign="top">
                    The List and Ink Control can be used to build a custom Image Gallery in which the List is used to display thumbnails of the
                    available images and when the user taps on a particular image, the full size image is shown in the Ink
                    control. The advantage of using the Ink control to display the image is so that you can take advantage
                    of the Ink controls pinch-zoom features and pan features to scale the image and to pan around to see
                    details of different parts of the image. The ability to actually draw ink (which of course is the primary
                    purpose of the Ink control) is not used in this case.

                    Options for Handling Write Conflicts when Syncing Data</td>
                <td valign="top">
                    When you build a disconnected mobile application, there is always a chance that the user will get a write conflict when they
                    sync data that was edited while they were offline. This could&nbsp; happen because some other user has
                    committed a change to a record before another user could commit their change.
                    <br>
                    <br> By default, when a write conflict occurs, the information about the conflict is sent to the user and
                    the user can resolve the conflict by selecting 'Their value' or 'My value'. However, there are other
                    powerful programmatic options for handling write conflicts. In this video we discuss the various techniques
                    for handling write conflicts.

                    Preventing User from Closing Pop-up Window if Grid or a Linked Child Grid is Dirty</td>
                <td valign="top">
                    It is common in web applications to have buttons that open a Grid component in a pop-up window. The Action Javascript builder
                    when you build this action has a built-in property that allows you to prevent the user from closing the
                    window if the Grid shown in the window is dirty. But what if the Grid shown in the window has Linked
                    child Grid components? You might want to also check that the child Grids are not dirty before the window
                    can be closed.
                    <br>
                    <br> In this video we show how this can be done.

                <td valign="top">
                    When you lay out a Form using the FormView control, by default, the controls on the form are rendered with one control per
                    line and each control taking up the full width of the FormView control. If you want to create a more
                    complex Layout you can either switch from Genie mode to the Freeform mode, or you can use Flow and Column
                    Layout Containers to control the layout of your Form.
                    <br>

                    But when you simply want to change some colors in a stylesheet, using the style editor may be more than

                    going dirty, etc.) or by a change in the value of one or more controls.

                    In this video we show how you can add a Button-Toggle to a ControlBar. Toggle buttons can either be two-state (switching

                    <br>
                    <br> The video shows how the state of a Button-Toggle is used to control what action a button performs when

                <td valign="top">
                    A common pattern in mobile apps is to have a button bar at the bottom of the screen with a series of buttons that allow you
                    to select the active Panel that is shown on the device. Typically, these buttons are spread out so that
                    they fill the width of the screen.
                    <br> The button-list control is ideal for implementing this pattern.
                    <br>
                    <br> In this video we show how a Button-List can be configured to fill the width of the screen and to select
                    a Panel Card in a Panel Layout when one of the buttons in the Button-List is tapped.

                    is powered by Google Maps.

                    When you define Javascript functions in a ControlBar (and also a ViewBox and FormView control), you can specify where the
                    Javascript should be stored. The options are: At the control level, at the UX level and 'This object'.

                    You can send SMS messages from the Grid and the UX. The messages are sent using the Twilio service, so you will need a Twilio
                    account. You can use Action Javascript to define the action which sends the message.
                    <br>
                    <br> There are a large number of options for customizing the message, such as sending messages in different

                    Creating Offline HTML5 Applications using the Application Cache</td>
                <td valign="top">
                    The Application Cache (an HTML5 feature widely supported by various browsers) allows you to build 'offline' applications
                    - i.e. applications that can be loaded into the browser even if there is no internet connection.
                    <span style="color: #000000">In order to load the application initially an internet connection is obviously needed. But once the application
                        has been loaded initially, all of the files (e.g. CSS.Javascript, images, etc.) referenced by the
                        application are cached in the browser and an internet connection is not needed to load the application
                        subsequently.
                        <br>
                        <br> If the application is updated, then if an internet connection is available when the app is loaded,
                        the new version of the app is downloaded and cached in the browser.
                        <br>
                        <br> In this video we show how offline HTML5 applications can be created using the Application Cache
                        feature.

                    The List control is one of the most commonly used controls in a UX component. But because of the richness of the List, there
                    can be many properties that need to be set to configure a List. After you have configured a List, you
                    can save all of the settings for the List in a named file. Then when you define your next List, you can
                    restore the settings from the named file - saving a lot of time.
                    <br>
                    <br> This video demonstrates how List settings can be saved and restored.

                    A common pattern in many applications (both Mobile and Desktop web) is to display pop-up modal forms to collect some information
                    from the user. Displaying pop-up modal forms using the ControlBar is very easy and extremely powerful.
                    <br>
                    <br> This video shows how a ControlBar 'disclosure' is used to display a pop-up modal form. The 'a5-action'
                    attribute in the Disclosure HTML is used to invoke actions defined in the ControlBar's Action pane.

                <td valign="top">
                    When you design a FormView control you may want the form to display calculated values (typically computed from other fields
                    in the form). Since the Form is really just an HTML template that is rendered using Alpha Anywhere's
                    client-side templating features, this is easily done.
                    <br>
                    <br> In this video we show how a calculated field is added to the FormView control.

                    The ink control allows you to create sketches by 'drawing' with your mouse, any type of pointing device, or with your finger
                    (on a device that supports touch). A common use of the ink control is to annotate images. The image you
                    want to annotate is shown as the background to the ink control and then you can draw 'on top of' the
                    image. When the data are saved the ink is stored separately from the image in a long text field.
                    <br>
                    <br> In this video we show how a data bound UX component that allows a user to upload images can be configured

                    Adding List Navigation Buttons to a ControlBar</td>
                <td valign="top">
                    When you define a List control, you can specify that the List should be paginated. If you set the pagination method to 'Navigation
                    Buttons' then you must define buttons to move to the next and previous page of records. In a mobile application
                    that uses a ControlBar in a Panel header or footer, it is desirable to place these navigation buttons
                    in the ControlBar.
                    <br>
                    <br> In this video we show how you can quickly add List navigation buttons to a ControlBar by selecting the
                    'Pre-defined buttons' option when adding ControlBar items to your ControlBar definition.

                    Using a FormView Control to Edit Data in a List Control - Master-Detail Forms - Very Large Forms</td>
                <td valign="top">
                    By default, when you configure a List with a Detail View (so that edits can be made to the List data), the Detail View is
                    composed using individual controls (e.g. Textbox, Textarea, Dropdown, etc). If the Detail View has a
                    large number of fields, then composing the Detail View using individual controls will be inefficient
                    and will result is a very large UX component that may not perform well.
                    <br>
                    <br> An alternative approach is to use the FormView control to implement the List's Detail View. This is
                    extremely efficient and will allow you to build UX components that edit very large forms but still perform
                    very well.
                    <br>
                    <br> In this video we show how a master-detail Form is built using a FormView control to edit the fields
                    in the Master table and a second FormView control to edit the fields in the Detail Table. The master
                    table has 100 fields and the detail table has 100 fields, so in total, the UX component is editing 200
                    fields.

                    Tutorial - Building a Mobile Master-Detail Form using The List, FormView and ControlBar Controls - </td>
                <td valign="top">
                    In this video tutorial we show how a mobile app can be built to implement a master-detail form using the FormView control.
                    The app will allow users to edit data from the Customers and Orders table in the sample Northwind database.
                    This is a classic master-detail form: Each customer has multiple orders. The UX component uses two Lists
                    joined in a parent-child relationship. The parent List displays data from the Customer table and the
                    child List display the related orders from the Orders table.
                    <br>
                    <br> Each List has a Detail View, but in both cases, the Detail View is implemented using the FormView control.
                    <br>
                    <br> Once the basic functionality of the app has been built, the app is 'mobilized' by wrapping the various
                    sections of the component in PanelCards and a ControlBar is added to implement navigation between the
                    various parts of the application.

                <td valign="top">
                    The ink control allows you to create sketches by 'drawing' with your mouse, any type of pointing device, or with your finger
                    (on a device that supports touch). A common use of the ink control is to annotate images. The image you
                    want to annotate is shown as the background to the ink control and then you can draw 'on top of' the
                    image. When the data are saved the ink is stored separately from the image in a long text field.
                    <br>
                    <br> In this video we show how a data bound UX component that allows a user to upload images can be configured
                    to allow the user to annotate the images that are uploaded.

                    Using a FormView Control to Edit Data in a List Control - Master-Detail Forms - Very Large Forms</td>
                <td valign="top">
                    By default, when you configure a List with a Detail View (so that edits can be made to the List data), the Detail View is
                    composed using individual controls (e.g. Textbox, Textarea, Dropdown, etc). If the Detail View has a
                    large number of fields, then composing the Detail View using individual controls will be inefficient
                    and will result is a very large UX component that may not perform well.
                    <br>
                    <br> An alternative approach is to use the FormView control to implement the List's Detail View. This is
                    extremely efficient and will allow you to build UX components that edit very large forms but still perform
                    very well.
                    <br>
                    <br> In this video we show how a master-detail Form is built using a FormView control to edit the fields
                    in the Master table and a second FormView control to edit the fields in the Detail Table. The master
                    table has 100 fields and the detail table has 100 fields, so in total, the UX component is editing 200
                    fields.

                    Tutorial - Building a Mobile Master-Detail Form using The List, FormView and ControlBar Controls - </td>
                <td valign="top">
                    In this video tutorial we show how a mobile app can be built to implement a master-detail form using the FormView control.
                    The app will allow users to edit data from the Customers and Orders table in the sample Northwind database.
                    This is a classic master-detail form: Each customer has multiple orders. The UX component uses two Lists
                    joined in a parent-child relationship. The parent List displays data from the Customer table and the
                    child List display the related orders from the Orders table.
                    <br>
                    <br> Each List has a Detail View, but in both cases, the Detail View is implemented using the FormView control.
                    <br>
                    <br> Once the basic functionality of the app has been built, the app is 'mobilized' by wrapping the various
                    sections of the component in PanelCards and a ControlBar is added to implement navigation between the
                    various parts of the application.

                <td valign="top">
                    If you have built a very large mobile App which takes some time to load, you might want to display a custom wait message
                    to the user while the main UX component of your App is loaded in the background.
                    <br>
                    <br> In this video we show how this can be done using a simple 'startup' UX component.

                <td valign="top">
                    The PhoneGap cordova-open plugin allows you to open various file types using the associated native app on a mobile device.
                    For example, if you open a .pdf file, the PDF file is displayed using the native PDF viewer app on the
                    mobile device. If you open a .mp4 file, the video is displayed using the native video viewer on the device.
                    A common use case for this plugin is to download several files when a connection is available so that
                    the files can then be viewer later on when no connection is available.
                    <br>
                    <br> In this video we show how an application is built that shows a list of PDF files. These files are downloaded
                    from the server and stored in the filesystem on a mobile device. Then we show how each of the downloaded
                    files can be viewed using the PDF viewer on the mobile device. Because the PDF files are stored in the
                    filesystem on the device, they can be viewed even if the device no longer has a connection. The application
                    uses the 'PhoneGap - Open File with Native Application' action to display the .pdf file.

                    PhoneGap- Viewing Reports in PDF Format on a Mobile Device</td>
                <td valign="top">
                    The PhoneGap cordova-open plugin allows you to open files (such as .pdf files) using the natvie application associated with
                    that file type on a mobile device. This plugin is particularly useful for viewing PDF files. The Alpha
                    Anywhere report writer can save reports as PDF files. The cordova-open plugin therefore fits really well
                    with the Alpha Anywhere report writer because you can build applications that generate reports as PDF
                    files and then display the reports on a mobile device using the cordova-open plugin.
                    <br>
                    <br> In this video we show how you can use Action Javascript (the&nbsp; 'PhoneGap - Open File with Native
                    Application' action) to generate a PDF file from an Alpha Anywhere report, then download the resulting
                    PDF file to a mobile device and display it using the native PDF viewer.

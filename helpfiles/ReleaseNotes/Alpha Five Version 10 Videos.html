                choices that are shown in the edit-combo box is filtered on the value in some other control that you have
                filled in. For example, you might have filled in MA into the State field. When you open the Edit-combo, only
                cities in MA will be shown.

                    combo, Javascript is used to filter the data that is already in memory.</p>

                to the server. These callbacks are system callbacks (i.e. the user does not have to do any programming- Alpha
                Five generates the callbacks automatically).
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>There may be situations in which you want to program your own user-defined Ajax callback (for example, to

                    using Action Javascript. When the callback is made, a user specified Xbasic function is called to handle
                    the callback. This function will typically compute some Javascript commands to send back to the Browser.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    properties in the Grid. In your callback handling event, instead of writing Javascript to send back to
                    the client, you simply set properties of the e._set object and Alpha Five automatically generates the
                    appropriate Javascript response.</p>

                    if the form has a large number of fields, the error icon can be too subtle and is easily overlooked.

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The Grid object exposes many methods that you can call from Javascript event handlers in your Grid components.
                    Typically, your Javascript looks like this:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>{grid.object}.methodName();</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>'{grid.object}' is a placeholder that gets replaced with the Grid object alias at run-time. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>There are situations where a Grid is opened as a child of a parent Grid and you want to execute a method
                    on the the Grid's parent Grid. In this case, you can't use the {Grid.object} placeholder. This video
                    explains how you can get a pointer to a Grid's parent Grid.</p>

            <td> A very popular feature of a Dropdown control is that it allows you to store an 'id' value, but display a text
                value. For example, in an Order Items table, you might store the 'product id' value, but display the corresponding
                'product name' field. When the user is editing data they can select from a list of product names, which is
                obviously much easier than having to enter a product id.
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>A significant drawback, however, of using dropdown controls is that the list of choices for the control has
                    to be loaded when the Grid is loaded. If the list is small, then this does not represent a problem. However,
                    what if the list is extremely large? This would cause a significant slowdown in loading the Grid. If
                    the Grid displayed multiple rows, then the problem is even worse because the list will be downloaded
                    for each row in the Grid!</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>These videos show a technique where the auto-suggest control is used rather than the dropdown control. The
                    user still enters a product name and the corresponding product id gets stored in the table.
                    <br> &nbsp; </p>
                <p>Because the list of choices does not have to be loaded up front, the Grid will load much more quickly, and
                    then when a list of choices is presented to the user, it is pre-filtered based on the characters the
                    user has already typed into the field.</p>

                when a user inserts, updates or deletes a record are automatically computed by Alpha Five.
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In some cases, a user might want more control over how these SQL statements are executed, or might want to
                    use stored procedures to insert, update or delete records.</p>
                <p>The
                    <b>onBeforerSQLCommandExecute</b> and
                    <b>onAfterSQLCommandExecute</b> server side events allow you fully customize the SQL statements that the
                    Grid executes in order to insert, update or delete records.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In addition, another common use for these events is to update some other table at the same time as the update
                    is being performed in the tables the Grid is based on. For example, you might want to add a record to
                    a log table.
                    <br> &nbsp; </p>
                <p>When you perform updates against some other table as part of our update, insert or delete, you might want
                    to wrap the entire operation into a single transaction. This is easily done by starting a transaction
                    in the onBeforeSQLCommandExecute event and then either committing or rolling back the transaction in
                    the onAfterSQLCommandExecute event.</p>

            <td>
                <p> This series of videos shows an in-depth example of a custom Ajax Callback. The video shows how a record in
                    the Grid can be deleted. Before the record is deleted a callback is made to the server to see if the
                    user is allowed to delete the record. If so, then custom SQL commands are executed (using AlphaDAO).
                    The videos then show how the action can be enhanced by prompting the user for confirmation after it has
                    been determined that the user is allowed to delete the record. </p>
                <p> &nbsp;</p>
                <p> In a desktop application prompting the user for confirmation is simple because there is no concept of server-side
                    and client-side code execution that you need to be aware of. But in a Web application, the act of prompting
                    the user for confirmation when a server-side event is executing is more complex because the prompt has
                    to be executed client-side. The video shows how the callback is divided into two separate callbacks,
                    and how the confirmation prompt is executed on the client-side.</p>

            </td>
            <td> When you open a Grid component in a Tabbed UI pane, if you then try to close the tab pane when the Grid is dirty,
                you get a warning that the Grid is dirty and you have to either save the Grid or abandon the changes. This
                behavior is 'built-in' to the Tabbed UI.
                <br>
                <br> However, if you open an .A5W page in a Tabbed UI pane (that contains a Grid, or multiple Grids, for that
                matter), there is no built-in checking before a Tabbed UI pane is closed. These videos show how you can you
                own custom coding to trap if the Tab pane is 'dirty' and prevent it from closing.
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The code works by setting an arbitrarily named property of the Tabbed UI object called 'gridIsDirty'</p>

            <td> In a Grid component that is based on a SQL database, the Insert, Update and Delete SQL statements that are executed
                when a user inserts, updates or deletes a record are automatically computed by Alpha Five.
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In some cases, a user might want more control over how these SQL statements are executed, or might want to
                    use stored procedures to insert, update or delete records.</p>
                <p>The
                    <b>onBeforerSQLCommandExecute</b> and
                    <b>onAfterSQLCommandExecute</b> server side events allow you fully customize the SQL statements that the
                    Grid executes in order to insert, update or delete records.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In addition, another common use for these events is to update some other table at the same time as the update
                    is being performed in the tables the Grid is based on. For example, you might want to add a record to
                    a log table.
                    <br> &nbsp; </p>
                <p>When you perform updates against some other table as part of our update, insert or delete, you might want
                    to wrap the entire operation into a single transaction. This is easily done by starting a transaction
                    in the onBeforeSQLCommandExecute event and then either committing or rolling back the transaction in
                    the onAfterSQLCommandExecute event.</p>

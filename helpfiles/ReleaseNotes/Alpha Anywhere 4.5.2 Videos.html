            </td>
            <td valign="top">The Tree control can be automatically populated with data derived from a SQL query. When doing this it is common to want
                to execute some Javascript code when the user selects a leaf node in the tree.
                <br>
                <br> In this video we show how this is done.

                Selecting Multiple Values in an Auto-suggest or Edit Combo Control</td>
            <td valign="top">
                The Auto-suggest and Edit Combo controls have always allowed you to set a mode where multiple selections can be made. However,
                each time you make a selection the pick list is closed and you must reopen the pick list before you can make
                your next selection.
                <br>
                <br> Now, a new property in these controls allows you to specify that the pick list should stay open after each
                selection, allowing you to make multiple selections more easily.

                Using the Built-in ControlBar Templates</td>
            <td valign="top">
                The ControlBar is highly configurable. This allows you to create solutions for many different use cases. There are several
                common patterns that developers use and for many of these patterns you can get a quick start by selecting
                one of the pre-defined ControlBar templates. For example, common patterns addressed by the pre-defined templates
                are:ControlBar with a menu button that animates in a menu from the left or right side of the Panel, ControlBar
                with buttons that reveal animated drop-down menus, ControlBar with buttons that allow you to create a tabbed
                user interface.
                <br>
                <br> In this video we show how you can create a new ControlBar from a template and then continue to modify the
                resulting ControlBar.

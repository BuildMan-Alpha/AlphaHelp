        <h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
    </a>
    <p>The <strong>Switch control in the UX Component has been changed</strong> . A new property has been added The previous Switch control Width property has been renamed Control container Width and a new Switch Width property has been added. This gives you more control over the appearance of the Switch control.</p>
    <p class="sectionWarning">Switch controls in existing applications will be unaffected by this change until you edit them. When an existing Switch control is modified, or if the control is recalculated using other means, the width of the control will change to use the Switch width, not the Control container width. In order to restore your Switch to its original size, copy the Control container width to the Switch width.</p>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <a name="section3_Developer">
        <h4>Developer Environment</h4>
    </a>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/index?search=webproject%20git%20integration"><strong>Git Integration</strong></a> - Commit your projects to a Git or GitHub repository directly from the Alpha Anywhere IDE. Git and GitHub support is now integrated into the Web Control Panel.</li>
            <li>Launch the <strong>Windows Command Window</strong> directly from the Web Projects Control Panel. Useful when working with Git.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <a name="section3_Publishing">
        <h4>Publishing</h4>
    </a>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Incremental Publishing support for Alpha Cloud</strong> - Alpha Cloud can now publish only the files that have changed. For large projects, publishing only the files that have changed can vastly reduce the amount of time it takes to publish your application to the cloud.<br>Select the "Only publish changed files?" checkbox in the Alpha Cloud Publish dialog to do an incremental publish.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <a name="section3_Security">
        <h4>Security</h4>
    </a>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/index?search=application%20server%20settings%20ssl#section1_Minimum Protocol Version"><strong>Application Server - TLS 1.3</strong></a> can now be used as the minimum protocol version when accessing your applications. (NOTE: Not all browser clients support TLS 1.3.)</li>
            <li>Classic Application Server - Security settings are automatically cleared on published.</li>
            <li><a href="https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/index?search=two%20factor%20auth"><strong>Two-factor Authentication</strong></a> has been added for Alpha Anywhere applications. Two-factor authentication provides a more secure way for users to log into an application. The log-in process is divided into two stages. In the first stage the user is prompted for their username and password. If the username and password are successfully validated, the log-in process advances to the second stage where the user is prompted to enter an authentication code.<br>Two-factor authentication can be added to any web or mobile application. Simply configure how the authentication process should be handled, test the app in-house to verify that the behavior is what you want, then distribute your app to your users.<br>Two-factor authentication in Alpha Anywhere supports sending text messages, emails, or using the Google Authenticator Application to validate a user's credentials.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <a name="section3_Mobile">
        <h4>Mobile Applications</h4>
    </a>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/index?search=phonegap%20wkwebview%20plugin"><strong>WkWebView Integration</strong></a> - iOS's UIWebView plugin, which is used to render the controls in PhoneGap applications, is deprecated and will be removed from a future version of iOS. The WkWebView is Alpha Software's replacement for UIWebView. You can now choose to use the WkWebView in lieu of the UIWebView in your PhoneGap applications. It is critical that you switch your PhoneGap applications to use the WkWebView plugin before the next version of iOS is released.<br>The following actions no longer work with UIWebView. If you use these actions, you must switch to the WkWebView.
                <ul>
                    <li>Camera access using the HTML5 option
                    <li>File Upload - Amazon S3</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added support for <strong>Cordova-Sqlite-Evcore-Extbuild-Free Plugin</strong>, which is required when building Android PhoneGap applications with CLI-8.0.0. This plugin uses a special Android NDK SQLite database access library (C-language implementation), with some premium improvements to the internal JSON interface between the Javascript and native Android implementation, to provide significant performance and memory usage improvements on the Android platform.</li>

            <li><strong>Enhanced support of native SQL expressions</strong> used in Lists has been added. If the query used to populate a List control uses Native SQL Syntax and cannot be parsed by Alpha's SQL Parser, a simplified builder is shown when you open the SQL Query Builder.</li>
            <li><strong>SQL JSON data type support was added</strong>. Alpha Anywhere will treat fileds in a table configured as a JSON data type as JSON data. The JSON data type may or may not be available in your system of record. Consult your database documentation for more information.</li>
            <li>Expanded support for importing data from <a href="https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/index?search=api%20office%20functions"><strong>Excel files in Xbasic scripts</strong></a> (see Xbasic Below).</li>

        <li><strong>UX Component - MultiSelectTokens Control - inputFocus() Method - NotInList Event</strong> - Fixed a regression resulting in the NotInListEvent not firing when the user typed a value into the multi-select-tokens control.</li>
        <li><strong>UX Component - List and ViewBox - DelayRenderTillVisible</strong> - Both the List and ViewBox controls have a property that delays the rendering of the data in the control (property is only available for certain data source types, such as SQL) until the control is actually visible. Determining if the List or VieBox is visible is now more robust and this property should now behave more predictably.</li>
        <li><strong>UX Component - Ajax Callbacks - Radio Buttons</strong> - As a result of a recent regression, if the UX was "clean" the value of Radio Button controls in the e.dataSubmitted object passed to the Xbasic function handler was not set.</li>
        <li><strong>SQL Builder - Focus</strong> - Fixed a focus issue when the Filter tab had focus and the user tried to edit the SQL text.</li>
        <li><strong>UX Builder - HTML Controls - Class Name</strong> - The way in which the user specified class name for certain controls (i.e. textbox, textarea, etc.) is applied has been fixed. Now, when you specify a class name you can specify if the class name is in addition to, or replaces the default class name for the control. Prefix the class name with a + character to indicate it is in addition to the default class name for the control type. If you do not use the + prefix, the class name you specify is used in place of the default class name for the control type.</li>
        <li><strong>AlphaDAO - Oracle - PortableSQL - AddMonthsToDate() Function</strong> - Changed the way native SQL is generated for Oracle for the AddMonthsToDate() portable function.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Server - Memory Leak</strong> - Fixed a memory leak when running old UX components that had not been edited and saved for a long (unclear how far back) time.</li>
        <li><strong>UX Component - Repeating Sections - Image and File Upload - Data Binding</strong> - Fixed an issue when uploading images or files in a Repeating Section. The uploaded file information was not persisted to the corresponding data bound field in the target table.</li>
        <li><strong>AlphaDAO - Native SQL - Trailing Spaces</strong> - If the SQL statement you executed using Native SQL contained a trailing CRLF and did an insert, the last inserted identity was not correct.</li>
        <li><strong>UX and TabbedUI Component</strong> - In certain cases the server would return a 500 error reporting an issue in the a5wcb_createBackupForImportedComponent() (the reported error was: Error calling 'XDialogBox' .a5wui method')</li>
        <li><strong>Application Server - Gzip Caching</strong> - The Application Server was not correctly recognizing that a static asset had changed after it was initially requested. For example, say you requested:<br/><br/>http://www.myapp.com/image1.jpg<br/><br/>Then changed image1.jpg on the server and then requested:<br/><br/>http://www.myapp.com/image1.jpg?1234<br/><br/>The new image was not rendered.</li>
        <li><strong>UX - List Control - Action Javascript - Filter Records in a List - Date Fields - Range Search</strong> - Fixed an issue when executing a range search on a Date type fields (Datetime fields worked OK).</li>

        <h2>Bug Fixes &amp; Enhancements</h2>
    </a>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>UX Component - Javascript</strong> - {dialog.object}.setListTemplateAndPopulate() Method - Fixed this method that allows you to define a new template for a List's Freeform layout and also populate the list with data.</li>
        <li><strong>List Control - Custom Data Source - Server-side Conditional Formatting and Server-side Display Format</strong> - If the Xbasic function that produced the data for a List that was based on a Custom data source did not return "proper" JSON (e.g. it returned *[js:[{name: 'Fred Jones'}]]* as opposed to *[js:[{"name": "Fred Jones"}]]* and if the List used any server-side Display form or Conditional Style, the List did not render any data.</li>
        <li><strong>UX Component - Copy and Paste Controls - Collapsed Containers</strong> - Fixed an issue with copy/paste of container controls that were in a 'collapsed' state.</li>
        <li><strong>Grid Components - Radio Button Controls - Client-side Show/Hide and Enable Expressions</strong> - Fixed an issue where a client-side expression was based on the value in a Radio Button control.</li>
        <li><strong>Trace Window - Working Preview</strong> - Fixed an issue when writing to the Trace window from a component that was running in Working Preview.</li>
        <li><strong>UX Component - Fields Tab - Client-side Conditional Style</strong> - Fixed an issue were certain types of expressions were being incorrectly flagged as invalid in the Conditional Style Builder.</li>
        <li><strong>UX Component - List and ViewBox Controls - Delay Render Till Visible</strong> - Fixed an issue that occurred when a List or ViewBox control had their *[ui:Delay Render till Visible]* property checked and the List or ViewBox was inside a PanelCard that was inside a PanelLayout or a PanelNavigator.</li>
        <li><strong>UX Builder - Text and Language Tags</strong> - Fixed an issue that could occasionally occur when getting a list of the text and language tags used in a component.</li>
        <li><strong>PhoneGap - PhoneGap-Shell-V2 Template - IIS</strong> - </li>
        <li><strong></strong> - Made a change to the PhoneGap-Shell-V2 Template to fix an issue when the Server was set to point to an IIS server.</li>
        <li><strong>Alpha Cloud - Publish - Security Data</strong> - There were occasional errors when publishing security data to Alpha Cloud. This was tracked down to the MySQL bulk loader not being thread safe. This has now been addressed. *[This change does not affect on-premise IIS installations which did not have any problem.]*</li>
        <li><strong>UX Component - Data Bound - New Record - Unbound Controls</strong> - When you clicked on the New Record button to create a new record in a data bound UX, the values in any unbound controls on the component were getting reset to their initial values. The values in controls that were not data bound should not have been updated.</li>
        <li><strong>UX Component - Find Command</strong> - A regression was introduced in the last release causing the Find command to fail if the UX contained any Embedded Component controls.</li>
        <li><strong>UX Component - Repeating Section - *[js:.setValue()]* Method</strong> - The *[js:.setValue()]* method allows you to set the value in a specific row in a Repeating Section. For example, *[js:{dialog.object}.setValue('LASTNAME:3','Smith')]* should set the value of the *[js:LASTNAME]* control in the 3rd logical row in the Repeating Section. This failed if the Repeating Section had been previously resized to a number of rows that was smaller than its original size and then increased to a number of rows greater than its original size.</li>
        <li><strong>UX Component - *[js:.getValue()]* Method</strong> - In certain rare situations, the *[js:.getValue()]* method returned an incorrect value if the UX was not dirty.</li>
        <li><strong>UX Component - *[js:.getValue()]* Method - Watermark</strong> - If the UX was clean, the *[js:.getValue()]* would return the wrong value for controls that were displaying the Watermark text. Once you had replaced the Watermark value with a typed-in value *[js:.getValue()]* would return the correct value.</li>

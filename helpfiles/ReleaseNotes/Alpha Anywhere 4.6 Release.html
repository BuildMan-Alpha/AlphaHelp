        <h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
    </a>
    <p>The <strong>Switch control in the UX Component has been changed</strong> . A new property has been added The previous Switch control Width property has been renamed Control container Width and a new Switch Width property has been added. This gives you more control over the appearance of the Switch control.</p>
    <p class="sectionWarning">Switch controls in existing applications will be unaffected by this change until you edit them. When an existing Switch control is modified, or if the control is recalculated using other means, the width of the control will change to use the Switch width, not the Control container width. In order to restore your Switch to its original size, copy the Control container width to the Switch width.</p>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <a name="section3_Developer">
        <h4>Developer Environment</h4>
    </a>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/index?search=webproject%20git%20integration"><strong>Git Integration</strong></a> - Commit your projects to a Git or GitHub repository directly from the Alpha Anywhere IDE. Git and GitHub support is now integrated into the Web Control Panel.</li>
            <li>Launch the <strong>Windows Command Window</strong> directly from the Web Projects Control Panel. Useful when working with Git.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <a name="section3_Publishing">
        <h4>Publishing</h4>
    </a>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Incremental Publishing support for Alpha Cloud</strong> - Alpha Cloud can now publish only the files that have changed. For large projects, publishing only the files that have changed can vastly reduce the amount of time it takes to publish your application to the cloud.<br>Select the "Only publish changed files?" checkbox in the Alpha Cloud Publish dialog to do an incremental publish.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <a name="section3_Security">
        <h4>Security</h4>
    </a>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/index?search=application%20server%20settings%20ssl#section1_Minimum Protocol Version"><strong>Application Server - TLS 1.3</strong></a> can now be used as the minimum protocol version when accessing your applications. (NOTE: Not all browser clients support TLS 1.3.)</li>
            <li>Classic Application Server - Security settings are automatically cleared on published.</li>
            <li><a href="https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/index?search=two%20factor%20auth"><strong>Two-factor Authentication</strong></a> has been added for Alpha Anywhere applications. Two-factor authentication provides a more secure way for users to log into an application. The log-in process is divided into two stages. In the first stage the user is prompted for their username and password. If the username and password are successfully validated, the log-in process advances to the second stage where the user is prompted to enter an authentication code.<br>Two-factor authentication can be added to any web or mobile application. Simply configure how the authentication process should be handled, test the app in-house to verify that the behavior is what you want, then distribute your app to your users.<br>Two-factor authentication in Alpha Anywhere supports sending text messages, emails, or using the Google Authenticator Application to validate a user's credentials.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <a name="section3_Mobile">
        <h4>Mobile Applications</h4>
    </a>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/index?search=phonegap%20wkwebview%20plugin"><strong>WkWebView Integration</strong></a> - iOS's UIWebView plugin, which is used to render the controls in PhoneGap applications, is deprecated and will be removed from a future version of iOS. The WkWebView is Alpha Software's replacement for UIWebView. You can now choose to use the WkWebView in lieu of the UIWebView in your PhoneGap applications. It is critical that you switch your PhoneGap applications to use the WkWebView plugin before the next version of iOS is released.<br>The following actions no longer work with UIWebView. If you use these actions, you must switch to the WkWebView.
                <ul>
                    <li>Camera access using the HTML5 option
                    <li>File Upload - Amazon S3</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added support for <strong>Cordova-Sqlite-Evcore-Extbuild-Free Plugin</strong>, which is required when building Android PhoneGap applications with CLI-8.0.0. This plugin uses a special Android NDK SQLite database access library (C-language implementation), with some premium improvements to the internal JSON interface between the Javascript and native Android implementation, to provide significant performance and memory usage improvements on the Android platform.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <a name="section3_Reporting">
        <h4>Reporting</h4>
    </a>

    </a>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enhanced support of native SQL expressions</strong> used in Lists has been added. If the query used to populate a List control uses Native SQL Syntax and cannot be parsed by Alpha's SQL Parser, a simplified builder is shown when you open the SQL Query Builder.</li>
            <li><strong>SQL JSON data type support was added</strong>. Alpha Anywhere will treat fileds in a table configured as a JSON data type as JSON data. The JSON data type may or may not be available in your system of record. Consult your database documentation for more information.</li>
            <li>Expanded support for importing data from <a href="https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/index?search=api%20office%20functions"><strong>Excel files in Xbasic scripts</strong></a> (see Xbasic Below).</li>
            <li>List Controls can now use an <a href="https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/documentation/index?search=uxlist%20excel%20datasource"><strong>Excel File</strong></a> or <a href="https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/documentation/index?search=uxlist%20csv%20datasource"><strong>CSV File</strong></a> as a data source.</li>

        <h2>Bug Fixes &amp; Enhancements</h2>
    </a>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>List Control - Synchronization - Write Conflicts -</strong> List synchronization has changed such that if two or more users make the same edit to a field (e.g. set the 'username' to 'Steve'), it does not result in a write conflict.
        <li><strong>List Control - Server-side Sorting -</strong> Sort direction icons are now shown in the List column headings if list columns are sorted on the server.
        <li><strong>List Control - Excel Import -</strong> Fixed issue where columns with mixed data types would fail to import properly into a List control.

        <li><strong>Style Sheets - &lt;Project Style&gt; -</strong> Fixes for cases where the &lt;Project Style&gt; was set to a version 4 style (e.g. 'Alpha', or a style inherited from Alpha)
        <li><strong>UX Component - File and Image Download Actions -</strong> The option to set the client-side filename for the downloaded file by calling a Javascript function was not implemented.
        <li><strong>Component Builders - Property Grid -</strong> Fixed a number of issues with the Property Grid in the various component builders.
        <li><strong>Xbasic - JSON_Generate() Function -</strong> The json_generate() function now encodes CRLFs as \r\n. Previously, these were encoded as \n.

        <li><strong>Components - &lt;ProjectStyle&gt; -</strong> Fixed an issue where components were not getting the correct style sheet when the component style was set to &lt;ProjectStyle&gt;.
        <li><strong>Desktop Applications - Network Optimize -</strong> Refreshing a shadow database would fail if the master database was on a mapped drive that pointed to a network share.

        <li><strong>Web Applications - APIs -</strong> Fixed bug when publishing API - The host name in the &lt;serviceName&gt;.json file was getting hard coded to the Live Preview URL if you had done a live test of the API while developing the API subsequently to the last time you edited the API.
        <li><strong>Grid Component - Advanced Search Control -</strong> Failed if the Grid was opened on an Ajax callback.
        <li><strong>Grid Component - Arguments - Page Variables -</strong> The option to bind an argument to a Page Variable was missing.</li>

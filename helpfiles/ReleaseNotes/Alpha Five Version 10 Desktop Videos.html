                to a particular record in the dropdown browse and then when you click on a record in the dropdown browse,
                the dropdown browse is closed and the record shown in the Form is changed to show the record that you selected
                in the dropdown browse.
                <p>Alternatively, you can type a value into the control and press enter, which navigates you to the correct
                    record.

                backup of your Layout or Field Rules and it keeps all previous backups as well.
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>At any point you can right click on a Layout in the Control Panel and revert to any prior version of that

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Now, you can add headers and footers to your form so that when the window that contains the form is smaller
                    than the form itself and the window has a vertical scroll bar, the header and footer section always remain
                    visible.

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Similarly, you can place locked content sections on the left and right hand side of the form so that when
                    the window has a horizontal scrollbar, these locked content sections remain visible.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Headers and footers and great for placing buttons and logos that you want to be visible at all times, regardless

                <p>A 'dynamic' tree is populated dynamically as you expand each node in the tree. For example, if you have a
                    dynamic tree that shows countries, then states, then cities and the companies, when the tree is initially
                    shown, it only contains a list of countries - so populating it is extremely fast. Only when you start
                    expanding the country nodes, does it do queries to get a list of states in the selected country, and
                    so on.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The genie allows you to build dynamic trees against SQL and DBF data sources.

                <p>For example, you might have four dropdownboxes. The first control will show a list of countries. When you
                    make a selection in the first control, the second control is populated with the states in the selected
                    country. When you make a selection in this control, the third control is populated with a list of cities
                    in that state, and so on.</p>

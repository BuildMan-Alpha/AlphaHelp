			<b><tbl>.to_sql_filter() Method</b>&nbsp;<br />
Takes an Xbasic syntax filter  expression and converts it to a SQL syntax expression. If the entire filter  cannot be converted to SQL, then converts part of the expression to SQL and  shows the remainder that is still in Xbasic syntax.
<p><strong>Syntax: </strong><br />
c <i>filter</i> = <tbl>.to_sql_filter(C <i>XbaseFilter</i> [, C  <i>separator</i>]])</p>
<p>If the filter contains multiple clauses, joined with the .AND. operator, then  it is possible that some of the clauses can be converted to SQL syntax, while  other clauses cannot be converted (typically because they call a function that  has no equivalent in the remote database).</p>
<p>The <i>separator</i> defines the character string that will be used to  separate the part of the filter that can be converted to SQL syntax, and the  part that could not be converted.</p>
<p>Assume that you have an active-link table on the sample 'customers' table  from Northwind.&nbsp; Some of the active-link fieldnames are different than the  corresponding fields in the remote table (assume that 'contactname' in the  remote table is mapped to 'name' in the active-link table, and that 'region' in  the remote table is mapped to 'state_region' in the active-link table).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p class="xbasic">?t.to_sql_filter("name = \"john smith\" .and. state_region =  \"ma\" .and. localUDF(companyname) = \"alpha\"","||")<br />
= ContactName='john  smith' and Region='ma'||localUDF(companyname)="alpha"<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the above example, only part of the filter could be converted. The  separator that was specified was '||', and so the portion that could not be  converted is shown after the '||' string. The portion that could not be  converted uses a function called 'localUDF()' which presumably does not exist on  the remote database, and therefore this part of the filter clause cannot be  converted.</p>
<p>Note that in the part that is converted the '.and.' operator is changed to  'and' and the double quotes are converted to single quotes.</p>

<p class=A3Topic>Addin Manager</p>



<p class=A5>Background Information</p>



<p>An Addin is a special library of scripts and functions.Alpha Anywhere stores 
 global scripts and functions in a library file (an .ALB file) of the same 
 name&nbsp;as&nbsp;the Database file (the .adb file).</p>



<p>Normally, the scripts and functions that you create in a Database are 
 only available when that Database is open. If you have created a library 
 of scripts and functions that you want to use when another Database is 
 open, you can attach the script library to that Database (using the <span 
 class=Button>File > Database Properties</span> command).</p>



<p>Alpha Anywhere also allows you to compile the scripts and functions in a 
 library into a special Compiled Script Library (which has an .AEX extension). 
 Like scripts and functions in an .ALB file, a Compiled Script Library 
 can also be attached to a Database (using the File, Database Properties 
 command).</p>



<p>However, unlike the scripts and functions in a .ALB file, a Compiled 
 Script Library can be made into an Addin. The scripts and functions in 
 an Addin are universally available, regardless of what Database is currently 
 open. In effect, the scripts and functions in an Addin are "part 
 of" Alpha Anywhere.</p>



<p>To make a Compiled Script Library into an Addin, you simply copy the 
 .aex file into the "addins_installed" folder under the Alpha 
 Five program folder. In addition to the "addins_installed" folder, 
 Alpha Anywhere also has an "addins_disabled" folder under the main 
 Alpha Anywhere program folder. The .aex files in this folder are the Addins 
 that have been temporarily disabled.</p>



<p class=A5><a name=Using_the_Addin_Manager>Using the Addin Manager</a></p>



<p>To open the <span class=Screen>Addin Manager</span> dialog box, select 
 the <span class=Button>Tools > Addin Manager...</span> .</p>



<p>Alpha Anywhere displays the <span class=Screen>Addin Manager</span>, showing 
 both the currently installed Addins, and the disabled Addins. The installed 
 Addins have a check in the box to their left.</p>



<p>Using this dialog you can easily install any disabled Addins, or disable 
 any installed Addins. You do not need to restart Alpha Anywhere after changing 
 the list of installed Addins.</p>



<p>Addins provide a powerful mechanism for developers to add new features 
 to Alpha Anywhere itself.</p>

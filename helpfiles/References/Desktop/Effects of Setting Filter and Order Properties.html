<p class=A3Topic>Effects of Setting Filter and Order Properties</p>



<p class=A5>Effects of Setting Filter and Order Properties</p>



<p>In forms in which you have saved filter/order criteria, queries act 
 differently. While queries can be used to change the order of records 
 that appear, they cannot be used to include records which do not satisfy 
 the filter criteria you saved in the form's layout.</p>



<p>For example, you have a table in which you store information about employees, 
 and you save filter criteria in the form's layout so that the form only 
 displays employees in the Marketing department. If you use a query to 
 select records in which employee salaries are greater than $30,000, you 
 will only see records of employees in the Marketing department whose salaries 
 are greater than $30,000.</p>



<p class=A5>Saving filter and order criteria in a form has other effects:</p>



<p>Because a query is run when the form is opened, there may be a significant 
 delay when the form is first opened. The length of the delay depends on 
 the speed of your computer, the number of records that need to be processed, 
 and the complexity of the query criteria. Creating indexes that Alpha 
 Five's Lightning Query Optimization can use will, in many cases, dramatically 
 speed up queries.</p>



<p>Unlike an index, a query-list is not updated&nbsp;as&nbsp;New records 
 are entered and existing records are changed or deleted. Until you update 
 the query, the records you enter are not placed in the correct sequence, 
 and records entered by another user on the network do not appear. To update 
 the query-list you can either press <span class=Button>F5</span> or select 
 <span class=Button>Form > Refresh Display</span>.</p>

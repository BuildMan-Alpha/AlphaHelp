<p class=A3Topic>Object Explorer </p>



<p>Clicking <span class=Button>View > Object Explorer</span> when a Layout 
window (e.g. Form, Report, Label, Letter, Browse) has focus (in either run, or 
design mode) displays the <span class=Screen>Object 
 Explorer</span> window. This utility allows to you identify the components 
 of a layout and examine all of their properties. </p>



<p>Unlike the <span class=Screen>Properties</span> dialog boxes, which 
 are displayed by right-clicking on an object, the <span class=Screen>Object 
 Explorer</span> is modeless, meaning that you can leave the <span class=Screen>Object 
 Explorer</span> window open while continuing to work on your layout. <a HREF="http://support.alphasoftware.com/imagesV8/Object_Explorer.gif"><a class="wiki"  href="Picture" rel="">Picture</a></a></p>



<p class=Pix><img src="images/Object_Explorer.gif"

					style="border: none;

							width: 495px;
							height: 468px;
							border-style: none;
							border-style: none;"
					width=495
					height=468
					border=0></p>



<p>If you need a reference to an object on your layout, select 
 it in the <span class=Screen>Object Explorer</span> and click <span class=Button>Copy 
 to Clipboard</span>. The following menu allows you decide if you want 
 a <span class=Bolded>relative</span> and <span class=Bolded>explicit</span> 
 name for the object. </p>

<p class=A5><a name=Finding_Objects>Finding Objects</a></p>



<p>A particularly useful feature of the <span class=Screen>Object Explorer</span> 
 is the ability to find an object on a layout. For example, if you have 
 a large, complex layout with many objects on it, finding "button23" 
 might be difficult. You can just select the object name in the <span class=Screen>Object 
 Explorer</span>, and then click the <span class=Button>Select Object</span> 
 button. Conversely, you can select an object on a layout, then click <span 
 class=Button>Current Object</span> in the <span class=Screen>Object Explorer</span> 
 to see its properties.</p>



<p>The ability to view the <span class=Screen>Object Explorer</span> in 
 <span class=Bolded>View Mode</span> is useful to developers who might 
 like to quickly see the effect of changing one of the properties of an 
 object.</p>



<p class=A5>Relative and Explicit Object Names</p>



<p>Every object (i.e. button, field, embedded browse etc.) that you place 
 on a form or browse has name. In a script, when you refer to an object 
 on a form, you can use a "relative" or "explicit" 
 object name.</p>



<p>The concept of <span class=Bolded>relative</span> and <span class=Bolded>explicit</span> 
 names is best explained by analogy.</p>



<p>Assume you are telling someone how to find a particular person's home 
 which is at 123 Main Street. If you are standing on Main Street when you 
 are asked this question, your answer can be simply "go to number 
 123". This is a relative address because you are already on Main 
 Street. Your answer is relative to Main Street.</p>



<p>However if you are standing on Walnut Street when you are asked this 
 question, your answer needs to be a little more explicit. You can say 
 "go to 123 Main Street". Of course, if you are in the United 
 Kingdom when you are asked this question, your answer needs to be even 
 more explicit. You might say "go to 123 Main Street, in Boston, Massachusetts, 
 in the United States". This answer will allow you to find the person's 
 house no matter where you are when you ask the question.</p>



<p>Similarly, if you have a script on a button on a form, and that script 
 refers to another object on the same form, then a relative address for 
 that object will be sufficient.</p>



<p>For example, say you wanted to refer to the "text" property 
 of an object called " <span class=Code1>lastname</span> ". The 
 relative object name is " <span class=Code1>topparent:lastname</span> 
 ", and the relative property name is " <span class=Code1>topparent:lastname.text</span> 
 ". The object name can be interpreted&nbsp;as&nbsp;follows - start 
 at the highest level of the form ( <span class=Code1>topparent</span> 
 ). This level contains an object called " <span class=Code1>lastname</span> 
 " (the : symbol is used to indicate that the object on the right 
 is contained within the object on the left of the : symbol).</p>



<p class=Note><span class=Note><img src="images/icon_warning.gif"
									x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
									style="border: none;
											width: 37px;
											height: 33px;
											float: none;
											border-style: none;
											border-style: none;"
									width=37
									height=33
									border=0>Note</span> : " <span 
 class=Code1>topparent</span> " is an alias that refers to the highest 
 level in the current form. Refer to <a href="../../Unclassified/Relative Addresses.html" title="Relative Addresses" class="wiki">Relative   Addresses</a> for more information on aliases.</p>



<p>If this form was called " <span class=Code1>customers</span> ", 
 then the explicit object name is " <span class=Code1>:customers:lastname</span> 
 ", and the explicit property name is " <span class=Code1>:customers:lastname.text</span> 
 ". The object name can be interpreted&nbsp;as&nbsp;follows - start 
 at the highest level of Alpha Anywhere. This level contains the form " 
 <span class=Code1>customers</span> ". The " <span class=Code1>customers</span> 
 " form contains the object " <span class=Code1>lastname</span> 
 ".</p>



<p>The advantage of using relative names where possible is that your script 
 will not break if the form name is changed. Also if you open more than 
 one instance of the form, your scripts will continue to work. They may 
 not work&nbsp;as&nbsp;you would expect if you use explicit names.</p>



<p>Consider the above example where the form is called " <span class=Code1>customers</span> 
 ". If you open two instances of this form, the first instance has 
 the name " <span class=Code1>customers</span> ", and the second 
 instance has the name " <span class=Code1>customers0</span> " 
 (or some other unique name). The script in the second instance of this 
 form will continue to refer to the <span class=Code1>lastname</span> control 
 on the first instance of this form - probably now what you would want.</p>

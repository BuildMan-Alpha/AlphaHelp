<p class=A3Topic>Managing Addins</p>



<p class=A5>Background Information</p>



<p class=Normal>An Addin is a special library of scripts and functions.</p>



<p class=Normal>Alpha Anywhere stores global scripts and functions in a library 
 file (an .ALB file) of the same name as the Database file (the .ADB file).</p>



<p class=Normal>Normally, the scripts and functions that you create in 
 a Database are only available when that Database is open. If you have 
 created a library of scripts and functions that you want to use when another 
 Databse is open, you can attach the script library to that Database (using 
 the File, Database Properties command).</p>



<p class=Normal>Alpha Anywhere also allows you to compile the scripts and functions 
 in a library into a special Compiled Script Library (which has an .AEX 
 extension).</p>



<p class=Normal>Like scripts and functions in an .alb file, a Compiled 
 Script Library can also be attached to a Database (using the File, Database 
 Properties command).</p>



<p class=Normal>However, unlike the scripts and functions in a .ALB file, 
 a Compiled Script Library can be made into an Addin. The scripts and functions 
 in an Addin are universally available, regardless of what Database is 
 currently open. In effect, the scripts and functions in an Addin are "part 
 of" Alpha Anywhere.</p>



<p class=Normal>To make a Compiled Script Library into an Addin, you simply 
 copy the .AEX file into the "addins_installed" folder under 
 the Alpha Anywhere program folder. In addition to the "addins_installed" 
 folder, Alpha Anywhere also has an "addins_disabled" folder under 
 the main Alpha Anywhere program folder. The .aex files in this folder are 
 the Addins that have been temporarily disabled.</p>



<p class=A5>Using the Addin Manager</p>



<p class=Normal>To open the <span class=Screen>Addin Manager</span> dialog 
 box, select the <span class=Button>Tools > Addin Manager...</span> 
 command. </p>



<p class=Normal>Alpha Anywhere displays the <span class=Screen>Addin Manager</span>, 
 showing both the currently installed Addins, and the disabled Addins. 
 The installed Addins have a check in the box to their left.</p>



<p class=Normal>Using this dialog you can easily install any disabled Addins, 
 or disable any installed Addins. You do not need to restart Alpha Anywhere
 after changing the list of installed Addins.</p>



<p class=Normal>Addins provide a powerful mechanism for developers to add 
 new features to Alpha Anywhere itself.</p>

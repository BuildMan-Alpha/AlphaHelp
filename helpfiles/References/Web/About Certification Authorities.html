<p class=A3Topic>About Certification Authorities</p>



<p>This explanation was abstracted from the <a href="http://www.thawte.com/ssl-digital-certificates/free-guides-whitepapers/pdf/auth_eng.pdf">Value 
 of Authentication</a> available from <a href="http://www.thawte.com/"><span

<p class=A5>The risks associated with eCommerce.</p>



<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Spoofing: The low cost 
 of website design and the ease with which existing pages can be copied 
 makes it all too easy to create illegitimate websites that appear to be 
 published by established organizations. In fact, con artists have illegally 
 obtained credit card numbers by setting up professional looking storefronts 
 that mimic legitimate businesses.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Unauthorized Action: A 
 competitor or disgruntled customer can alter your website so that it malfunctions 
 or refuses to service potential clients.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Unauthorized Disclosure: 
 When transaction information is transmitted "in the clear", 
 hackers can intercept the transmissions to obtain sensitive information 
 from your customers.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Data Alteration: The content 
 of a transaction can be intercepted and altered en route, either maliciously 
 or accidentally. User names, credit card numbers and currency amounts 
 sent "in the clear" are all vulnerable to alteration.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>A critical issue is how to win a customer's trust and convince all those 
 millions of wary would-be e-shoppers that it is perfectly safe to make 
 online purchases on your web site. The easiest and most secure way to 
 achieve this is with authentication and encryption.</p>



<p class=A5>Establishing Identity</p>



<p>A business partner's identity must be established before it can be trusted 
 in conducting trade. At the most basic level, there must be a process 
 which verifies that an organization or individual exists, has a name, 
 and is entitled to use that name. This process may also establish other 
 identification attributes: for example, organizational affiliation ("Jim 
 Smith works for Philips"); industry segment ("Vivendi is in 
 the entertainment industry"); or occupational certification ("John 
 Smith is a board-certified dentist in England"). Trusted third parties 
 or delegated authorities often play a key role in confirming the identity 
 attributes of participants at the time identification takes place.</p>



<p class=A5>Credential Management</p>



<p>Once the participant's basic identity and identification attributes 
 are established and verified, it must be issued with a credential that 
 can be used to prove identity. In the "real" world, a credential 
 might be an ID document or a business license. In the digital world, the 
 most robust form of credential is the digital or Server Certificate signed 
 by a trusted Certification Authority.</p>



<p class=A5>How Authentication Works</p>



<p>Authentication allows the receiver of a digital message to be confident 
 of both the identity of the sender and the integrity of the message. When 
 Web visitors connect to websites, they reach one of two kinds of servers. 
 If the servers are secure, visitors will get messages indicating that 
 fact; similarly, if they are not secure, there may be warnings to that 
 effect. A secure web site is one that has been authenticated, a complex 
 process involving public keys/digital certificates, and private keys. 
 The certificate tells users that an independent third party has agreed 
 that the web site belongs to the company it claims to belong to. A valid 
 certificate means that users can be confident that they are sending confidential 
 information to the place they think they are sending it.</p>



<p>A System Administrator generates a certificate request, which in turn 
 creates two encrypted keys: one private, one public. The System Administrator 
 sends off the public one to a trusted organization referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;a 
 Certification Authority (CA). The heart of trust in a public key infrastructure 
 is the CA. Fundamental to this trust is the CA's root cryptographic signing 
 key, which is used to sign the public keys of certificate holders, and 
 more importantly its own public key. The compromise of a CA's root key 
 by malicious intent, inadvertent errors, or system failures can be of 
 catastrophic proportions. Hence, this root signing key must be diligently 
 protected by the best technologies and practices within the cryptographic 
 community.</p>



<p>The basic premise is that the CA is vouching for the link between an 
 individual's identity and his or her public key. The Certification Authority 
 provides a level of assurance that the public key contained in the certificate 
 does indeed belong to the entity named in the certificate. The digital 
 signature placed on the public key certificate by the CA provides the 
 cryptographic binding between the entity's public key, the entity's name, 
 and other information in the certificate, such&nbsp;as&nbsp;a validity 
 period. For an end user to determine whether a legitimate CA issued the 
 certificate, the end user must verify the issuing CA's signature on the 
 certificate.</p>



<p>CA's must be absolutely certain that they are issuing certificates to 
 the "correct" company. They must be sure that the company they 
 are certifying owns the Internet Domain Name they have certified, that 
 it is registered&nbsp;as&nbsp;a business in at least one country, and 
 that its registered name is the same&nbsp;as&nbsp;that on the certificate 
 the CA is signing. Once the CA has done what is, essentially, a background 
 check on all these elements, the CA signs off on the public key. That 
 comes back to the System Administrator, who loads it into the server. 
 When both the private and public keys, a matching pair, align perfectly, 
 the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) will start functioning.</p>



<p>SSL, another critical element of a secure Website, ensures that the 
 information sent by a server is identical to that received by a Web visitor 
 - that no change has taken place.</p>



<p class=A5>How does encryption work?</p>



<p>On the Internet, there are two main uses for encryption. One occurs 
 when you visit a "secure" website, such&nbsp;as&nbsp;an online 
 store or shopping mall. This is called server-side encryption because 
 it uses the Server Certificate given to the server (computer) that runs 
 the website. The other use occurs when you send or receive encrypted email. 
 In both cases, the encryption process involves exchanging public keys. 
 When encrypting information, the encryption process is done with either 
 a public or a private key and then decrypted with the matching public 
 or private key. Think of it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a lock that requires one key 
 to close the lock and another key to open the lock. For example, when 
 you visit a secure website, your computer receives the website's public 
 key. When your computer sends information to the website, your computer 
 encrypts it using the website's public key. The only way to decrypt the 
 information you are sending is with the web site's private key.</p>



<p>The same process is needed for secure email. Before you can send someone 
 an encrypted message, you need their Server Certificate, which contains 
 their public key. Your email application uses their public key to encrypt 
 the message. From that point on, only the recipient's private key can 
 decrypt the message. So, you can distribute your Server Certificate (and 
 its public key) to&nbsp;as&nbsp;many people&nbsp;as&nbsp;you would like 
 without harming the integrity of your Server Certificate. However, you 
 must guard your private key, since it is used to decrypt any messages 
 sent to you.</p>



<p>User authentication can be employed to determine which areas of information 
 are available to any particular user. There are two main types of authentication 
 to consider: message authentication and user authentication. Message authentication 
 establishes that the message says what it is supposed to say and comes 
 from where it purports to come from. Authentication gives you the edge. 
 An authenticated and secure Website can provide your business with powerful 
 competitive advantages. A certificate from a trusted Certification Authority 
 enables trusted online sales and application processes for products such&nbsp;as&nbsp;insurance, 
 mortgages, or credit cards.</p>



<p>With authentication you can reassure visitors to your site and give 
 them the confidence they need to purchase things, because they will trust 
 you. You can reach those customers who will submit information via the 
 Web only if they are confident that their personal information, such&nbsp;as&nbsp; 
 credit card numbers, financial data, or medical history, is secure.</p>

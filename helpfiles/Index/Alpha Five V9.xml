	<title>Welcome to Alpha Five V9. </title>
<description>This version of Alpha Five offers a number of features that make Alpha Five both powerful and easy to use.

A signature feature of this release is 'active-link' tables, which allows you to build enterprise class applications against SQL databases. Even if you don't use SQL databases, you will still find lot's of exciting new features in V9.

This document describes all of the features in Version 9. We hope you enjoy reviewing it as much as we have enjoyed creating V9!

Many of the descriptions of the new features are accompanied by video demonstrations. For a quick overview of what's new, we suggest that you start on the 'Videos of Selected New Features?' page.

V9 is available in two editions, 'Platinum' and 'Standard'. The 'Standard' edition includes all of the features of the 'Platinum' edition with the following exceptions:

	<title>Active-Link Tables</title>
	<cases>
		<case>
			<title>Creating Multiple Tables</title>
			<description>Active-link tables allow you to work with data in remote SQL databases. Active-link tables are like regular Alpha Five tables in that you can create Form, Reports, Operations, etc. using them. When you create active-link tables, you can either use a batch operation that creates multiple tables at once (using defaults for the various options), or you can create them one at a time, which allows you to customize the active-link table. If you choose the 'multiple' option, you can always go back and edit an individual active-link table's definition. This video shows how you can create active-link tables for all of the tables in a remote database in a single step. </description>

			<title>Using an Active-Link Table</title>
			<description>This video shows that the active-link table shows the data in the remote SQL table and that edits made in the active-link table are immediately persisted to the remote table. The video also shows the power of connection strings. By editing the connection string, you can change the remote database that all of the active-link tables in your application point to.</description>

			<title>Heterogeneous Joins</title>
			<description>A powerful feature of Alpha Five is the ability to create Forms and Reports that join data from multiple remote SQL databases. In this video we show an example of an Order Header table which is stored in SQL Server, and an Order Detail table which is stored in MySQL. An Alpha Five set is built that joins these two tables and a Form based on this Set allows us to edit and enter data into both databases.</description>

			<title>SQL Query Genie</title>
			<description>The SQL Query Genie allows you to filter and sort an active-link table. The Query Genie is 'two way' - which means that you can either use the builder to create the query, or you can type it in directly, and it will be parsed and shown in the builder so that you can continue editing in the builder.</description>

			<title>Optimistic Record Locking </title>
			<description>When working with active-link tables, Alpha Five uses a technique called 'optimistic record locking' to prevent one user from inadvertently overwriting changes made by another users. Contrast this with 'pessimistic record locking' - the technique used when two or more users want to edit the same record in a native Alpha Five table. In 'pessimistic record locking' when one user begins to edit a record, the record is locked, preventing the second user from editing. This video show how optimistic record locking works for an active-link table.</description>

However, the layout capabilities of the static HTML Object go way beyond what the RTF object offers. You have the full power of HTML to style the text in a static HTML object. You can also place fields in the object to show data from the current record, and hyperlinks that execute Xbasic scripts. </description>

There are several types of Browse Layout Controls, such as buttons to open forms, run reports, run scripts, and insert icons. In this video we use a Browse Layout control to put hyperlinks in a browse column that open a form to show the current record.

			<description>Mapped tables are a new feature that allow you to define virtual tables that display data from one or more linked physical tables. The mapped table can include all, or a subset of, the fields in the physical tables and can also include calculated columns. Mapped tables appear in the Control  Panel just like any other table. You can build Forms, Reports, Operations, etc. on Mapped Tables, just as you would on physical tables and set. All of the standard Xbasic commands for working with tables can be used with Mapped tables.</description>

			<title>AJAX</title>
			<description>Alpha Five now includes the 'Alpha Five Ajax Forms Library', a comprehensive Javascript library that dramatically eases the process of writing AJAX enabled web applications using Xbasic. Note: These videos all demonstrate pages that are included in the sample Web Application that ships with V9. This first video demonstrates the basic principle behind AJAX programming techniques. It shows how a piece of data can be submitted to a the server and a response can then be sent to the browser to update part of the page.

			<description>The second video demonstrates how AJAX techniques can be used to validate the data in a form. When the form's Submit button is pressed, data in the form is sent to the callback page and validated. Errors are written back to the page, and are displayed without a page reload.</description>

			<description>The third video demonstrates how AJAX techniques are used to implement cascading dropdown boxes. We show a form with a State, City and Customer dropdown box. When the user selects a state, the city dropdown box is dynamically repopulated, and when the user selects a city, the customer dropdown box is repopulated. When the user selects a customer, the customer information is displayed on the page, where it can be updated and saved.</description>

			<description>Next, we demonstrate how you can use AJAX to implement 'suggestion' lists as the user types into a textbox. We show how, as you type a name into a city field, AJAX callbacks can be used to present a list of cities that start with the characters you have typed. The video also shows filtered suggestions - where the suggestion list is filtered by the value in some other control you set on the page.</description>

			<description>This video shows how you can implement a tree control that uses AJAX callbacks to dynamically populate the tree. The tree control is implemented using the powerful new 'tree control' object in the 'Alpha Five Ajax Forms Library'. The video shows a tree that is dynamically populated with a list of unique state names from a customer table. When the user expands a state node in the tree, a callback dynamically populates the tree with a list of cities in that state. When the user expands a city node, another callback dynamically populates the tree with a list of customers in that city. Finally, when the user clicks on a customer name, the record for that customer is shown.</description>

			<title>HTML Form Supercontrols</title>
			<description>An HTML Form Supercontrol allows you to design parts of your form (or Xdialog) using HTML. This allows you to create stunning looking forms that take full advantage of the layout power of HTML and CSS. HTML Forms can contain fields from the table on which the form is based and Alpha Five automatically binds the fields in the HTML Form to the physical fields in the underlying table.</description>

		</case>
		<case>
		
			<description>A very powerful aspect of the HTML Form supercontrol is 'Property Binding' in which a property on the HTML Form (say the border color on an input control) is bound to an expression. This allows you to easily turn the border of the input control to red (for example) if an expression evaluates to a certain value.</description>

			<description>When you place an HTML Form supercontrol on a Form (or an Xdialog) you can use standard HTML controls (such as inputs, radio buttons, text areas, etc) in the HTML Form. In addition, you can also use several special 'Alpha Five controls' such as tab controls, accordion controls, conditional objects, etc. This video shows how you can place an Accordion control in an HTML Form supercontrol. It also shows how you can define event handlers for the events in the HTML Form using Xbasic. We show how you can handle the onclick event for a hyperlink using an Xbasic function.</description>

			<description>In this next video we show how you can put a button in the accordion control and then use standard CSS to style the button. An accordion control is like a list with sections. Opening one section can automatically close the currently open section. Accordions are a great way to present categorized menu choices to a user. We also show how you can use all of the built-in images that come with Alpha Five to decorate your forms.</description>

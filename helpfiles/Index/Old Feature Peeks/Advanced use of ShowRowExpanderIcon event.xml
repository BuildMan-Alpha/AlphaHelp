	<topic>Advanced use of "ShowRowExpanderIcon" event </topic>
<description>When you use the Row Expander feature in a grid, by default, the expand icon is shown next to each row in the grid, regardless of whether that row actually has any records. In some cases, you might want to suppress the row expander icon from showing if there if there are no child records. You can do this using the ShowRowExpanderIcon event.

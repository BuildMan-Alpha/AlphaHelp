	<description>Let's be honest, when you're dealing with the Web, you're dealing with the world. And now, in Alpha Anywhere, you can communicate with everyone in it thanks to the new foreign language support for Web applications.</description>

			<description>In an Alpha Anywhere grid definition, you can switch between virtually any language, whether it be U.S. English, U.K. English, Spanish, French, German, etc., etc., etc.</description>

			<description>That means a developer can build an app that with a flick of a switch can change the labels on forms and grids, and the instructions on the screen, from one language to another. It also means the developer doesn't have to create separate apps for various language marketplaces, but can use the same application in every instance.</description>

			<description>The app can even be designed to be generic so that the first question the user might be asked is what language they prefer, just like a bank ATM, and then the entire app would come up in the selected language.</description>

			<description>As an added bonus, Alpha Anywhere makes it possible for any labels or instructions to be computed on the fly in any language. Let's say the application is a medical app. When someone fills out a form, based on replies to questions on the form, the instructions can change from language to language, if needed</description>

	<description>Putting a button on a grid to open another grid or a report is easily accomplished using Alpha Five Version 10's Action Javascript. The video below shows how you can use the special Alpha Five functions, CurrentGridFilter and CurrentGridOrder, to print the records that are currently selected in the grid. You can also use these functions to open another grid showing the same selection of records in the current grid.</description>

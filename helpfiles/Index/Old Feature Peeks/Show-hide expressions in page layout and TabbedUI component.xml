	<description>In Alpha Five Version 10, you can use show or hide expressions in the page layout component to show or hide the objects that you place in the component. The expressions can refer to session variables and arguments defined in the component.

Using show/hide expressions, it's easy to show one user a page with one particular set of components, and another user a completely different set of components. In the case of the Tabbed UI component, the show/hide expressions can control which buttons are visible in the button pane. Have a look at the video for a full demo.

            <title>Problems Opening CHM Help Files Located on Other Computers
            </title>
            <description>If you have had problems opening CHM help files on other computers, it may have been caused by recent Microsoft security fixes. One symptom is a message beginning "Action Cancelled...". Apparently, opening a remotely located help file can expose your system to attack. The following registry can solve the problem, by allowing you to open CHM files on your intranet. There is more information at http://www.grainge.org/index.htm#authoring/ms05-026/ms05-026_update.htm.</description>

            </title>
            <description>Recently, a new Microsoft feature has caused some downloaded help files to display an "Action Cancelled" message when you attempt to view a topic. The solution to this problem is to open Windows Explorer, right click on the help file, and select Properties, then click Unblock. </description>

                    <description>Your email settings in Alpha Anywhere should be exactly the same as they appear in your regular email application (such as Outlook, Eudora).

                    <description>When you send email using the Alpha Anywhere email client, it's no different than sending email from your regular default client. if you send email to a "bad" address you'll receive an "undeliverable" notification when you check your mail.</description>

                    <description>The Alpha Anywhere email client can't be used with MSN, AOL, or Web email accounts, due to their proprietary security technology. The general rule of thumb is, if you can use a "regular" email client (such as Outlook, Eudora) to send/receive email with your account, then A5 should be able to do the same.</description>

                <p>Creating Alpha Anywhere help screens</p>
                <p>For each field there's an option on the object properties help tab. You can define help for a field by chapter and topic. e.g. if you have a form, "customer_info," and a field, "company_name," you can have help for the chapter "Customer information," topic "Company Name," that is called when you press F1 on the company_name field.</p>
                <p>You have the choice of either allowing Alpha Anywhere to name the help file, or naming it yourself. If you let A5 name the help file it creates a table with a version of the name of your database, e.g. "a_mydatabase_help.dbfs"</p>

                <p>Default Browse</p>
                <p>If you have memo fields, or long character fields in the browse, the default browse in Alpha Anywhere is two lines high so you can see more of your data.</p>
                <p>If you want single line high browses, you should create a custom browse layout that sets the browse row height to the height you want.</p>
                <p>If the browse does not have memos, only long character fields, you can select the View/Settings/Layouts category to set additional options.</p>

            <description>The following demonstration uses the AlphaSports sample database.</description>
            <steps>
                <step>
                    <description>Create the following function:</description>
                    <example><![CDATA[function line_items as C ()
dim tbl1 as P
dim tbl2 as P
dim items as C
tbl1 = table.get("invoice_items") 
tbl2 = table.get("product")
tbl1.fetch_first() 
items = "" 
while .not. tbl1.fetch_eof() 
   items = items + tbl1.product_id + tbl2.description + crlf() 
   tbl1.fetch_next() 
end while
line_items = items
end function ]]></example>
                </step>
                <step>
                    <description>Create an email template. Include this calculated field in the template: </description>
                    <example><![CDATA[<<line_items()|>>]]></example>
                </step>
                <step>
                    <description>Preview the email. This is what you get: </description>

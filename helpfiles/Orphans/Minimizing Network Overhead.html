<p class=A3Topic>Minimizing Network Overhead</p>



<p class=A5>Overhead considerations when designing for a networked application</p>



<p>Remember records are ?processed' on the local machine, which means data 
 has to pass through the network to the local machine. Ranges and queries 
 built upon Lightning Query Optimization only need to pass the index, not 
 the records, over the network. Think of an index and/or query&nbsp;as&nbsp;a 
 one-to-one relationship with the table.</p>



<p>Open tables and files in read only mode whenever possible.</p>



<p>Remember, every form opened up has all its underlying tables opened 
 also.</p>



<p>Try not to use referential integrity. If you need referential integrity, 
 create a special set for use only when it is absolutely necessary.</p>



<p>When designing indexes:</p>



<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Do not use filters. Use 
 a range instead. (Simple filters should not cause problems.)</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Use simple field values 
 for your index key values.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Do not use calculated fields 
 or expressions that are subject to frequent changes. Make sure the key 
 value of an index expression is not subject to change unless the record 
 is open in enter or change mode.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Never use variable values&nbsp;as&nbsp;all 
 or part of an index expression.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>One to many sets create multiple times more overhead than single tables 
 and one to one sets.</p>



<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>This subjective recommendation 
 must take into account how many tables, how many records, how many indexes, 
 how many linking values are constructed, referential integrity, etc.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Keep sets simple.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Use multiple specific simple 
 sets for your needs, rather than a large ?all encompassing' set.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Linking keys should be based on simple field values rather than complex 
 expressions or calculated fields.</p>



<p>Always if possible, use a simple "meaningless" field (e.g. 
 an auto incremented field) value&nbsp;as&nbsp;the linking key.</p>



<p>Avoid calculated fields that reference tables or indexes.</p>



<p>Use queries that are local (saved in a private directory)&nbsp;as&nbsp;opposed 
 to indexes which are global (maintained on a server).</p>



<p>The more enter/edit sessions open, the more overhead.</p>



<p>The more nodes on a network doing data entry, the more overhead.</p>



<p class=A5>Techniques to use if necessary</p>



<p>Only open&nbsp;as&nbsp;many tables and sets&nbsp;as&nbsp;you need.</p>



<p>Use forms based on a child table only to add records to a child table 
 of a set, while opening the set in read only mode.</p>



<p>When entering a new record, programmatically begin a new record and 
 save it immediately, then present it to the user in change mode.</p>



<p>For some reporting and data intensive routines, consider creating temporary 
 files locally by doing a copy command. Then processed records can either 
 be disposed of or written in a batch to the server files.</p>



<p>Keep tables open in enter mode for the shortest time possible.</p>



<p>Key values only needed for data intensive critical routines might be 
 created, built, used, and disposed of in the Xbasic script.</p>



<p>Programmatically monitor, create, and or rebuild your indexes.</p>



<p>Keep memo fields to a minimum and located in a separate linked table 
 if possible. Putting the memo field in a separate table also allows you 
 the ability to open this table separately, save an empty memo, then open 
 it up in change mode for the data entry. The reason for this is that the 
 indexes are written almost immediately so allows little opportunity for 
 index and network problems.</p>



<p>In all things be aware of the network ?traffic' that your routine will 
 cause and try to keep that to a minimum.</p>

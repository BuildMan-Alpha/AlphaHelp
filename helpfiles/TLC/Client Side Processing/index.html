<h1>Client Side Processing</h1>

<p>
Client-side processing is performed with Javascript, sometimes with the help of Native 
PhoneGap code in cases where the client needs to access hardware specific features,
such as the camera, the GPS, or the file system. 
<br/><br/>
PhoneGap Build is integrated with Alpha Anywhere, simplifying the process of creating 
native (hybrid) applications for Android, iOS, and Windows mobile devices. See 
PhoneGap.
<br/><br/>
As a rapid application development system, Alpha creates much of the Javascript for you,
so you can perform tasks like entering records and  navigating screens without the 
need to do any coding. 
<br/><br/>
In cases where you need to add functionality that is not included Alpha Anywhwere, 
Alpha allows you to hook your own code up to application events. Events are actions
that occur in your application, such as clicking a button, sliding a screen, 
changing the value of a field and many others. See Events
<br/><br/>
To create the Javascript code you can either write it yourself, or use Action Javascript,
which is a point and click builder that builds the Javascript for you. See Action Javascript.
<br/><br/>
Alpha Anywhere includes its own Javascript library called <a href="http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Server/Guide/Design/Platform/Javascript/Alpha%20Five%20Javascript%20Libraries%20The%20Core.JS%20Library.html">
Core.js</a>. and it also can automatically include the
<a href="http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Server/Guide/Design/View/CSS/JQuery%20Support.html">
jQuery and JQueryUI frameworks. 
</a>

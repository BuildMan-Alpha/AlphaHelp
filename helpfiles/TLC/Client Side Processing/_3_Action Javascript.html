Action Javascript
<br/><br/>
Action Javascript is a point-and-click wizard driven approach to building Javascript. 
By selecting from a list of predefined actions, and adding your own settings you 
can create sophisticated Javascript code without writing any code. The code created by 
Action Javascript can be further edited in the code editor.

<h1>Alpha Anywhere Technical Overview</h1>

<p>


	<p>Alpha Anywhere allows developers of varying skill sets, to create and deploy business
		applications for mobile devices and desktop/web. </p>



		<h2 >Architecture of Alpha Anywhere</h2>
		<p>Alpha Anywhere consists of a development IDE and a server.
		<br/><br/>
		The server allows applications to "call back" to run server side code. Some
		examples of server-side code include exchanging data with a SQL database or web service,
		running a report, or sending a batch of email messages.
		<br/><br/>
		There are 3 variations of the server. The first is the Development Server, which is 
		included in the development IDE. It's used for testing when you build you applications.
		<br/><br/>
		The other two variations are the Alpha Anywhere Application Server and the 
		Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS. You can use either one of these servers 
		when your application is deployed. All versions of the Alpha Application Server 
		run on Windows.
		<br/><br/>
		The development IDE is called the Alpha Anywhere Developer,
		which you use to build your both the client and server parts of your applications. Like the application server, this is also Windows-
		based. Many run the Alpha Anywhere Developer on 
		a virtual machine either on a Mac or an server they connect to using remote desktop from their Mac
		or PC. </p>


		
		<h2> Architecture of Applications Built with Alpha Anywhere</h2>
		<p>Alpha Anywhere applications consist of a client part and a server part. The client part 
		runs on Desktop/Web browser or on a mobile device. The server part is run using 
		the Alpha Anywhere Application Server, which runs on a Windows Server. 
		<br/><br/>
		On the client side, the applications use HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript code,
		and in the case of mobile devices, you can also use native code, to access
		hardware - like the camera, flashlight, and calendar. This native mobile
		code is created using PhoneGap Build, which is integrated with the software.
		<br/><br/>
		On the server side, applications can run Xbasic, Server-side Javascript 
		(Node.JS), and .Net assemblies written in any .NET supported language.

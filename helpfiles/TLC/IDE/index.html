<h1>The Alpha Developer IDE</h1>

<p>
The Alpha Developer is the integrated development environment (IDE), in which you 
build your application. It includes code editors, automation tools for writing and 
organizing your applications, preview screens, and a debugger. The main parts of the 
IDE are listed below. 
</p>


<h2>Control Panel</h2>

<p>The Control Panel is an interface for keeping track of 
the files and components in applications built specifically for the Windows desktop. It 
is included for backward compatibility with Alpha Five, and is generally not used when 
building web and mobile applications.</p>




<h2>Web Projects Control Panel</h2>
<a href="webprojectscontrolpanelFullsize.jpg" alt="click to enlarge" border="none"><img src="webprojectscontrolpanel.jpg"></a>
<p>The Web Projects Control Panel is the primary 
interface for working with the files and settings of your application. From this 
control panel you can launch editors to create or modify your application. You 
can preview your application, and you can publish it for deployment.

<a href="uxcomponentFullsize.jpg" alt="click to enlarge" border="none"><img src="uxcomponent.jpg"  width="350px"></a>
<p>Alpha Anywhere applications are built out components. Some components 
are general purpose, like the UX Component, a primary building block for mobile applications.
Some are more specific, like the Google Map component. Each component type has its 
own component builder.</p> 
  

<h2>Report Editor</h2>

<p>Alpha Anywhere includes two types of a report builders/editors.
The first is called The Report Builder, and is not optimized for web/mobile use. It is 
included for backwards compatibility to Alpha Five. The second is called the 
Layout Table Report Editor, which is a robust, multi-banded report builder, which can be 
used to create PDFs, HTML reports, and formatter Excel files.

<p>Alpha Anywhere includes several code editors, including an 
HTML editor, an Xbasic editor, a Javascript Editor. In addition is offers 
Action Scripting and Action Javascsript to automatically generate tested code.

Javascript editors.</p>

<p>Preview your application with the Live Preview and Working Previews tabs. 
Previews can also include mobile simulators - allowing you to see how your 
application appears on different mobile devices.</p>

<p>Alpha Anywhere includes a debugger for examining and 
fixing your Xbasic code. It does not contain a Javascript debugger, and instead 
relies on the developer using Firebug or a similar debugger.</p>

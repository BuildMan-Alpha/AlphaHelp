<h1>The Alpha Developer IDE</h1>

<p>
The Alpha Developer is the integrated development environment (IDE), in which you 
build your application. It includes code editors, automation tools for writing and 
organizing your applications, preview screens, and a debugger. The main parts of the 
IDE are listed below. 
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Control Panel</b> - The Control Panel is an interface for keeping track of 
the files and components in applications built specifically for the Windows desktop. It 
is included for backward compatibility with Alpha Five, and is generally not used when 
building web and mobile applications. <br/>&nbsp;</li>


<li><b>Web Projects Control Panel</b> - The Web Projects Control Panel is the primary 
interface for working with the files and settings of your application. From this 
control panel you can launch editors to create or modify your application. You 
can preview your application, and you can publish it for deployment. <br/>&nbsp;</li>


<li><b>Component Editors</b> - The UX (also known as the user interface or user 
experience) for Alpha Anywhere applications are built out components. Some components 
are general purpose, like the UX Component, a primary building block for mobile applications.
Some are more specific, like the Google Map component. Each component type has its 
own component builder. For details see User Experience / User Interface.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>Report Editor</b> - Alpha Anywhere includes a robust, multi-banded report 
builder, which can be used to create PDFs, HTML reports, and formatter Excel files. 
Reports are created using the Report Editor.<br/>&nbsp;</li>


<li><b>Code Editors</b> - Alpha Anywhere includes several code editors,
including an HTML editor, an Xbasic Editor, a Javascript Editor, and action scripting 
editors that can be used to create Xbasic and Javascript, which can then be 
further refined in the Xbasic and Javascript editors. See the <br/>&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>Previews</b> - You can see a preview of your application in one of the three 
previews. Previews can be opened from within some of the component editors
as well as from the Web Projects Control Panel.<br/>&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>Debugger</b> - Alpha Anywhere includes a debugger for examining and 
fixing your Xbasic code. It does not contain a Javascript debugger, and instead 
relies on the developer using Firebug or a similar debugger.<br/>&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>Settings</b> - You can also adjust the look, feel and behavior if the 
the Alpha Developer IDE itself using the Settings dialog box, available from the 
View Menu when the Web Projects Control Panel is active.</li>
</ul>

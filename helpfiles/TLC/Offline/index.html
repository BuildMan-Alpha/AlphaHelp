<h1>Offline Data Caching, Capture, and Synchronization</h1>


<p>In order for a mobile application to function when an Internet 
connection is either unavailable or unreliable, the data your 
application needs to function must to be stored locally on 
the device. When signal is restored, newly entered (or 
edited) data can then be synchronized with data in the 
system of record.</p>



<h2>How Much Data Can be Stored?</h2>
<p>
Depending on how you set up your application, you can 
either store about 5MB of data, or you can store several GB or 
more. Applications that you access by pointing the device's browser 
to a URL can store up to 5MB in local storage. Applications
that are created with PhoneGap may access the device's 
file system, which can allow many GBs of storage. See the 
PhoneGap Documentation for details.
</p>



<h2>What Happens if There are Synchronization Conflicts?</h2>
It is possible that when a record is edited offline by one person,
that another person may also be editing that same record creating a data
conflict. Alpha Anywhere can resolve these data conflicts either by allowing 
the user to decide which value(s) to keep or by following a business rule 
and handling the conflict automatically.

<h1>Tutorial 2: Working With SQL Data in a List</h2>

Once you've completed the Hello World tutorial, this tutorial shows 
you how to build another two-panel mobile application. This time, the 
first screen shows a list of customers from a sample SQL database. When 
you click on a customer, a detail screen appears in which you 
view and can edit details about a particular customer.

This application is in the form of a 36m recorded webinar workshop, which you can find here:

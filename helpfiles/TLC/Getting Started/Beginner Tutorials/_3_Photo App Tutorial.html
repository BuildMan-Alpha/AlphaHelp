<h1>Tutorial 3: Photo App Tutorial</h1>




<p>

This tutorial is more ambitious than the Hello World
and Master/Detail tutorials. In this tutorial, you will 
build a real application over the course of about 90 minutes.
<br/>
You begin the tutorial by setting up a SQL table, which you then use to build a 
browser application. The application is then further built to work on a mobile 
device, and to access a phone camera. 
<br/>
The pace is slow enough so that you can build the 
application along with the video, without needing to stop and rewind. If you have a 
second monitor, or a tablet, we suggest that you view the video on that while following 
along in Alpha Anywhere to build the application.
<br/>

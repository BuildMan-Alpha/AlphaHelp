<h1>Server Side Processing</h1>
<p/>
Tasks like generating large reports, sending batches of email, 
and other resource-intensive tasks are typically run on the server,
to limit the burden on the mobile device or browser. 
<br/><br/>
The code that Alpha Anywhere uses to run these tasks is written in 
Xbasic, a programming language similar to Visual Basic. Most 
of the Xbasic code for an application is written automatically when you
create your application. 
<br/><br/>
However, there may be instances in which you want to include your 
own server-side code to add functionality that is not included 
in Alpha Anywhere. This can be accomplished in several ways.
<br/><br/>
To create your own server side code, you can:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn to write Xbasic code using the videos, tutorials and help.<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Use a point-and-click interface called Action Scripting to write Xbasic for you.<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Use another programming language to create a .NET assembly and call the assembly from Xbasic.<br/>&nbsp;</liL
<li>Use Javascript to create a Node.JS module and call the module from Xbasic<br/>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

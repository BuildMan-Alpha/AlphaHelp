<h1>Xbasic</h1>

<p>Xbasic is the server-side programming language of Alpha Anywhere, and is similar 
to Visual Basic and other languages. </p>

<ul>

<li><b>Xbasic Tutorials </b>- The Xbasic tutorial is the recommended way to get acquainted with and start 
 programming in Xbasic. This tutorial uses a Windows desktop application as the example,
 but still shows you the basics for mobile and desktop/web applications. 
 <a href="http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Server/Tutorial/Design/Platform/Xbasic/A%20Tutorial%20in%20Xbasic.html">

 </li>
 
<li><b>The Interactive Window </b>- The Interactive Window allow you to test  snippets of code
 before you add them to a script. See <a href="http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Server/Reference/Design/Platform/Xbasic/Reference/Using%20the%20Interactive%20Window.html">
 Using the Interactive Window</a>.<br/>&nbsp;
 </li>
 
 
<li><b>Libraries and Modules</b> - Keeps code organized and lets you share code with multiple components. <br/>&nbsp;

	<ul>
  	
 	<li><b>AEXs </b> - let you compile your scripts and functions 
 	into a compiled file, allowing global access to functions. 	For details about creating AEX files,
 	see <a href="http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Desktop/Guide/Design/Platform/Xbasic%20Action%20Scripting/Compiling%20Scripts%20and%20Functions.html">
 	Compiling Scripts and Functions</a>.
 	<br/><br/>
 	For details on loading AEX files onto the server so that you can use them see
 	<a href="http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Server/Guide/Design/Platform/Xbasic/Making%20User-Defined%20Functions%20Available%20to%20a%20Web%20Application.html">
 	Making User-Defined Functions Available to a Web Application.</a><br/>&nbsp;</li>
 	 		
 	<li><b>Xbasic Function Libraries </b>-  are a newer alternative to using AEX files for reusing Xbasic code. They can be linked into 
 	components (Grids, UXs, custom components, and tabbed UIs) in the properties section of these components.
 	<a href="//www.viddler.com/v/684ca43d">See video</a>. 
 	<br/>&nbsp;</li>

	<li><b>Modules </b>- let you package up Xbasic functions and classes for reuse, in a method 
	similar to the method used by Node.JS. Functions are then 
 	brought into any Xbasic code using the Require() method. (This is not to be confused with the "Module" 
 	object in Xbasic)

  	</ul> 	
</li>
 

<li><b>Xbasic Reference Guide </b>- includes a language reference and information about functions, 
expressions, operators, variables, the interactive window and more.  Much of the material 
uses Windows desktop applications as examples, but the information also applies to 
mobile and desktop/web applications as well. See the <a href="http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Index/Xbasic%20Reference%20Title.html">
Xbasic Reference Guide</a>.<br/>&nbsp;</li>

 
<li><b>Directory of Functions and Methods </b>- includes links to 
<a href="http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Index/Functions%20and%20Methods%20Title.html"> organized tables of 
functions and methods</a> that are included with Xbasic. <br/>&nbsp;</li>

</ul>

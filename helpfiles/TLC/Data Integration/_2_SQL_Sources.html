<h1>Connection Strings</h1>




<p> When building your application, connections to data sources are made using 
		connection strings, which are collections of settings including the type and 
		location of the database and the account credentials. 
		<br/><br/>
		A connection string can be created dynamically when the application is run using 
		Xbasic, but usually it is created ahead of time using the Connection String
		Dialog box.  
		<br/><br/>
		For help with the Connection String Dialog box, refer to:

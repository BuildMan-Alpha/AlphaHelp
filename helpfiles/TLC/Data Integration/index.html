<h1>Data Integration</h1>



<p>
Alpha Anywhere applications can perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) data operations 
directly with several different categories of data sources, including:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>SQL Databases</li>
	<li>Web Services</li>
	<li>NoSQL Databases</li>
	<li>Files</li>
</ul>

<p>
Alpha Anywhere applications can also integrate data from multiple sources at the same time,
helpful for creating reports, dashboards, and other business intelligence solutions.  
<br/><br/>
Connections are made using Connection Strings.

<h1>Web Services</h1>




<p> In addition to SQL backends, you can also use web services as a data source.
	If the web service you want to use follows the OData protocol, Alpha has connector 
	that you can use to build a connection string to the OData service. If the web 
	service uses another protocol, you may need to write (or acquire) a custom connector.
	</p>
	
	
	<h2>OData</h2> 
	<p>Alpha Anywhere includes a connector for OData data sources, which you can select 
	when you create a connection string. (See connection strings)
	<br/><br/>
	An example of OData in use with Alpha Anywhere can be found in this video:

	<h2>Custom Connectors</h2>
	<p>Custom connectors to web services can be written in Xbasic. For information 
	on doing this, contact guides@alphasoftware.com.

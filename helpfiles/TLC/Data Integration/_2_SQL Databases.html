<h1>SQL Databases</h1>




<p> Alpha Anywhere includes native drivers for  popular and enterprise back end SQL systems.
	This includes Microsoft Access, SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, DB2 and many others. This 
	allows you to connect to data you are already using in another system,
	without disrupting the other system. For example, if you had a web application 
	written in Ruby or a desktop application in Visual Basic (or MS Access), you could leave that system in 
	place and create a mobile application that shares data with the legacy system.

	<h2>SQL Tools</h2>
<p>		Alpha Anywhere includes a collection of tools for working with SQL databases.
		These include:
</p>		

<ul>	
			<li><b>The Database Explorer</b> - for viewing the structure of database, the structure 
			of its tables and views, as well as statistics and a preview of its data.
			See <a href=http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Desktop/Guide/Design/Data/DBF/Database%20Explorer.html">the Database
			Explorer documentation</a><br/>&nbsp;</li>
			
			<li><b>SQL Query Genie</b> - The SQL Query Genie is point and click tool for creating
			and testing SQL statements. See <a href="http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Desktop/Guide/Design/Data/SQL/SQL%20Genie.html">

			<li><b>SQL Command Window</b> - The SQL Command Window lets you type or paste SQL commands
			and then execute them against a backend SQL database.See 
			<a href="http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Server/Guide/Design/Data/SQL/SQL%20Command%20Window.html">The 
			SQL Command Window</a><br/>&nbsp;</li>
			
			<li><b>Portable SQL</b> -  Alpha Anywhere has its own, generic version of the SQL language,
			called Portable SQL, which is generated for you when you use the SQL Querie
			Genie and other tools. Before connecting to a database, Alpha automatically 
			translates Portable SQL to the correct native format for the SQL backend you are 
			using. See <a href="http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Server/Guide/Design/Data/SQL/Supported%20Portable%20SQL%20Syntax.html">Portable SQL Syntax</a><br/>&nbsp;</li>
			
			<li><b>Flying Start Genie</b> - The Flying Start Genie automatically builds a simple
			web application using the structure of a SQL database. You can then 
			modify the application to suit your needs. See <a href="http://news.alphasoftware.com/V10Preview/FeaturePacks/FeaturePack_FlyingStart.html">
			The Flying Start Genie</a><br/>&nbsp;</li>

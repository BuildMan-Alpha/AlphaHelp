<h1>SQL Databases</h1>




<p> Alpha Anywhere includes native drivers for  popular and enterprise back end SQL systems.
	This includes Microsoft Access, SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, DB2 and many others. This 
	allows you to connect to data you are already using in another system,
	without disrupting the other system. For example, if you had a web application 
	written in Ruby or a desktop application in Visual Basic (or MS Access), you could leave that system in 
	place and create a mobile application that shares data with the legacy system.

			translates Portable SQL to the correct native format for the SQL backend you are 
			using. Information about the syntax of Portable SQL can be found here:
			http://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/#/Server/Guide/Design/Data/SQL/Supported%20Portable%20SQL%20Syntax.html</li>

			modify the application to suit your needs.

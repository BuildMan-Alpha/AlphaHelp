<h1>Input and Output</h1>



<p>For input/output via a web service,
please refer to <a href="">Data Integration</a>. For output via report or charts,
see <a href="/Desktop/Guide/Design/View/Report/">Reports</a>.
 
 
 
 <h2>Supported Input</h2>
 
	Most business applications involve the collection of data, often in different
	formats. Alpha Anywhere can be used to capture a wide variety of data, listed below.
	So input methods make more sense for mobile devices, such as GPS capture, while
	others are generally used for web applications, such as the importing spreadsheet 
	files. 
	
	<ul>
	
	<li><b>Text and Numbers</b> - Alpha can capture text, numbers, and special characters from
	a keyboard or from a virtual keyboard (like the iPhone keyboard). It is also 
	possible to create customized virtual keyboards to make data entry more efficient.<br/>&nbsp;
	</li>
	
	
	<li>
	<b>Images</b> - Alpha can generate the code you need to capture images or select and 
	upload images from a web application or a mobile device. <br/>&nbsp;
	</li>

	<li>			
	<b>Data From Files</b> - Alpha can import data from CSV files, MS Access Files,
	MS Excel files, and other types of files. You can also write a custom routine 
	to import data from virtually any type of file. <br/>&nbsp;
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Documents</b> - Documents in PDF, TIFF, or any other format can be saved as individual
	files on a server, in a database, or on the cloud via a web service.<br/>&nbsp;
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Audio and Video</b> - Alpha Anywhere applications can capture audio and video from 
	the client device. Files can be saved on the local device, individually on the server
	or to a	cloud service. <br/>&nbsp;
	</li>

	<li><b>GPS and Maps</b></b> - Geographical information can be captured by accessing the GPS
	system of the client device. It can also be captured by dragging markers on a map.<br/>&nbsp;
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Digital Ink</b>	- You can capture notes	and drawing entered on touch screen by 
	a finger or stylus. The imported is stored as a scalable vector graphic, which 
	can be edited.<br/>&nbsp;
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>Signature Capture</b> - Signature capture is a digital ink control designed to 
	allow someone to sign their name using a finger or stylus. <br/>&nbsp;
	</li>

</ul>

 
 
 
 <h2>Supported Output</h2>
	
	<ul>
	
	<li><b>Email</b> - Alpha Anywhere has many built in Xbasic functions for sending and 
	receiving email.<br/>&nbsp;
	</li>
	
	
	<li>
	<b>PDF</b> - Alpha Anywhere allows you to create PDF reports. It also allows you to 
	create and manipulate PDF files using Xbasic and action scripting.<br/>&nbsp;
	</li>

	<li>			
	<b>Microsoft Office Excel</b> - Alpha Anywhere allows you to generate 
	and add to <a href="http://documentation.alphasoftware.com/web/main#/Server/Reference/Design/Api/Office/Generate%20Excel%20Spreadsheets%20Programmatically.html">
	Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets</a>

	for creating text files including RTF, CSV, XML and JSON files.<br/>&nbsp;
	</li>
	
</ul>

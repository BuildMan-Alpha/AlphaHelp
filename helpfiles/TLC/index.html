<h1>How to Use This Documentation System</h1>
<p>The collection of pages found here at alphasoftware.com/documentation
is currently the most complete source of written documentation available, including 
information from the Alpha Anywhere Online Help System (built into the product), 
and the Alpha Five Wiki (which is no longer updated).
<br/><br/>
The Table of Contents on the left is designed to be used as a shortcut to the commonly used 
resources. It does not contain links to every page in this documentation system. 
<br/><br/>
If you don't find what you need in the Table of Contents, use the Search Box to  
search through the roughly 5,000 pages found in the help system. 
<br/><br/>
In addition to written documentation, there are thousands of reference and tutorial
videos available on line in a searchable database at alphasoftware.com/video library
<br/><br/>
One last note, Alpha Anywhere is built on its predecessor, Alpha Five. Some of the 
documentation in this system was originally written for Alpha Five (and then updated), 
but you may still see occasional screenshots and other references to Alpha Five.

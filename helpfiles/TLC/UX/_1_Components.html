<h1>Components</h1>


[[[IN PROGRESS]]]

<p>

Components are collections of client-side and server-side code that give your 
application its look, feel, and functionality. You create them through 
the use of component builders in the Alpha Anywhere Developer IDE. 
<br/><br/>
There are currently 15 types of components, each with a corresponding builder. 
Most of these are for specific tasks such as the Video Player component
for playing videos, and the Google Map component for displaying maps. 
<br/><br/>
 
There is also a special component called the UX component, which is used to build the 
application's interface. In practise, many mobile applications will consist of just 
a single UX component. 

</p>

<h2>List of Component</h2>
<p>You can see the list of available components and component builders. To do this: </p>

<ol>
<li>On the Web Projects Control Panel, click the New button. The New File dialog box appears.
<li>Choose Web Component and click Next. A list of collection component types appears.</li>
<li>Click on a particular component to see its description at the bottom of the dialog.</li>
</ol>

<h2>UX Component</h2>
<p>
The UX component is the primary component for giving your application its look,
feel, and functionality. In fact, many Alpha Anywhere mobile applications 
consist of a single UX component and no other component types. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
The UX component is extensively documented in the 
<a href="http://www.alphasoftware.com/video-library/">
video library</a>. In particular, see the Training Video section, 
and look for the Intro to the UX Component series.

<h1>Adaptive and Responsive Design</h1> 


<p>
Applications that need to adapt to varying screen sizes or orientations can use either 
adaptive design, responsive design, or a combination. Adaptive designs determine the 
size and orientation of a device, and present a different interface depending on the device.
Responsive designs change the shape and positioning of controls on the device using a 
single interface that in which the controls (text fields, buttons, images, etc) can 
move to new positions and change size. Both approaches are discussed below.

<h2>Adaptive Design</h2>
<p>Alpha Anywhere can automatically detect the type of device on which the 
application is running and then launch the best interface for that device. This is 
done with the AppLauncher component, and is documented in

this blog article and video</a>.

<h2>Responsive Design</h2>
<p>Alpha Anywhere UX components can automatically reconfigure the size and position 
of controls depending on screen size and orientation. This is described in the following 
three videos:<br/><br/>

            <description>
                <p>To move an Alpha Anywhere Application Server license from one instance to another, the server with the license must be stopped and the license removed. Stopping the server will automatically deactivate the license, allowing you to activate the license on another server running the Alpha Anywhere Standard Application Server. Remove the license from the stopped server to the new server and start the Alpha Anywhere Standard Application Server.</p>
                <p>If the Standard Application Server is not stopped or is stopped through other means (force quit, hardware failure, etc), then the license cannot be activated until the server lease expires. The default lease lifetime is 15 minutes.</p>

            <title>Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition</title>
            <description>
                <p>You can install the Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition on as many machines as you want, but the license can only be active on one machine at a time.</p>
                <p>If you have installed Alpha Anywhere on two machines and tried to launch Alpha Anywhere on the second machine immediately after exiting Alpha Anywhere on the first machine, this would not be possible because the activation 'lease' has not expired. By default, the activation 'lease' for the Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition is 24 hours. The lease lifetime can be changed in the *[ui:View]* &gt; *[ui:Settings]* &gt; *[ui:Preferences]* menu command. However, the new lease lifetime will not take effect until the current activation for the license expires.</p>

                    <description>Specify the *[ui:Value]* in hours for desired lease length. For example, to set the lease lifetime to 30 minutes, you would enter a value of *[ui:0.5]*. A value of -1 will set the policy to 24 hours.</description>

                <step>
                    <description>Click *[ui:OK]* to save your changes. The new lease lifetime will take effect when the current lease expires. This may take up to 24 hours unless the license is deactivated through other means (e.g. using the *[ui:Deactivate License and Exit]* *[ui:File]* menu option.)</description>

This menu command eliminates the need to wait for the lease lifetime to expire. *[ui:Deactivate License and Exit]* is available in build 4184 or newer.</p>

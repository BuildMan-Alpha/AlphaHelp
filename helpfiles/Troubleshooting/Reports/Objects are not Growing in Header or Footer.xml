	<topic>Objects are not Growing What placed in a Header or Footer</topic>
    <description>Some of the Header and Footer types are fixed size, and do not support growable objects.</description>
    <discussion>
    <p>Page Headers and Footers, as well as Continuation Headers and Footers and Repeating Headers and Footers 
      are all fixed size, in order to keep page layout deterministic.</p>
    <p>Objects like memos and linked reports generally have the 'Growable' 
      property set because they are not fixed size.  If you place a 'Growable'
      object in a section that is fixed size, the Growable property is
      automatically disabled.</p>
    <p>If you need the header to contain Growable content, consider creating
    a Group and using a Group Header or Group Footer instead.</p>

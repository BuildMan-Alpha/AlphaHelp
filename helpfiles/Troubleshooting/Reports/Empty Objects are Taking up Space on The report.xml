    <description>A Report has controls that is taking up space when there is no content.</description>

        <p>Objects in a Report will take up the full space given to them during design time unless the 'Can Shrink' property is enabled.  This is a requirement for pre-printed forms.</p>
        <p>If an object contains no data (is blank), this can create empty space in the report.  For objects that require a large initial size (such as an image), this can result in large areas of unwanted blank space in a report.  To eliminate the space occupied by blank controls, the control's *[ui:Shrinkable]* property must be enabled.</p>

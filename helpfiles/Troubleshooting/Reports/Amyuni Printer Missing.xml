                    <description>The Amyuni printer is distributed as part of the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS. It is used to generate Reports. If the Amyuni printer fails to install or is uninstalled, you cannot create Reports using Alpha Anywhere. If the Amyuni printer is not installed, it may manifest as an error when you try to create a Report:</description>

                    <note>For versions of the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS older than build 3627, you will not be notified if the Amyuni installation failed. To determine whether or not the Amyuni install failed, you will need to check the installAmyuniPrinters.log file for errors. You can find the *[installAmyuniPrinters.log]* inside the *[Amyuni5]* folder in the installation directory. For example, *[bold:C:\Program Files (x86)\A5V12 Application Server for IIS\Amyuni5]*.</note>

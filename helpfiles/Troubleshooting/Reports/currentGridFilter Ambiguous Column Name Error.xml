    <description>"Ambiguous Column Name Error" occurs when using CurrentGridFilter()</description>
    <discussion>
        Reports can be filtered using the search criteria used in a Grid component using the special *[js:CurrentGridFilter()]* function for the *[ui:SQL Filter]* definition in the Report Print Genie. If the Report is not based on the same SQL query as the Grid component, an "Ambiguous Column Name Error" can occur. If you wish to use the *[js:CurrentGridFilter()]* function, then you must change the Report's SQL query to match the Grids. This can be accomplished by changing either the Report or the Grid's SQL query definition.

    <description>In some cases, text content is clipping in a PDF Report.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>Report controls automatically clip contents to prevent content overlap. In some instances, clipping is causing part or whole letters to disappear in text controls the rendered report.</p>
        <p>There are several options for fixing clipped content. The first is to make the report controls wider or taller. This process can be tedious.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can disable content clipping for the control.</p>
        <p>To disable clipping, select the Report control and check *[ui:Disable clipping]* in the control's properties.</p>

                <p>The following images demonstrate the difference between clipped content and unclipped content. The report in this example is based on the Northwind Category table. The controls have a background fill style to demonstrate the clipping area of the control. Note that the background color is still limited to the size of the control.</p>
                <p>With clipping enabled (the default), the control text is clipped both horizontally and vertically at the rectangular bounds of the control.</p>

                <p>In the above image, the content of the Categoryname and Description controls is clipped. To prevent the text clipping, the *[ui:Disable clipping]* property is checked for both controls.</p>

                <p>Now when the report is rendered, the text content extends beyond the bounds of the control, displaying the entire second line of the Description filed, which has word wrap enabled.</p>

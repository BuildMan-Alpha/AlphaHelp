<p><a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4312676/9859279/b3d8cd5c-5af3-11e5-9aad-634a0236feeb.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4312676/9859279/b3d8cd5c-5af3-11e5-9aad-634a0236feeb.png" alt="image" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>Sometimes Web Deploy does not get fully installed or, as the error message says the "Web Management Service" is not started.</p>

<p>The installer should be modified to ensure Web Deploy is fully installed and the needed services are running.</p>

<p><strong><em>Workaround:</em></strong> Ensure that the Windows services "Web Management Service" and "Web Deployment Agent Service" are running. </p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4312676/9859926/f601278a-5af6-11e5-955f-c1ecde5e6fcd.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4312676/9859926/f601278a-5af6-11e5-955f-c1ecde5e6fcd.png" alt="image" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>If the Web Management Service is not started, it can be enabled and started from IIS Manager. Open the Management Service feature,</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4312676/13092645/22f061fa-d4cf-11e5-9331-58c60124a7bc.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4312676/13092645/22f061fa-d4cf-11e5-9331-58c60124a7bc.png" alt="image" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>and then enable and start the Management Service.</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4312676/13092640/0e98e61e-d4cf-11e5-8718-747d165e309b.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4312676/13092640/0e98e61e-d4cf-11e5-8718-747d165e309b.png" alt="image" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>If "Web Deployment Agent Service" is missing, go to the Windows Control Panel - Programs and Features, find Microsoft Web Deploy 3.5, right click and then select change. Go to the next wizard page and you'll then need to click a Change button. Make sure all the features are installed. It should look like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4312676/9859893/c38fa1c8-5af6-11e5-8c72-0af614e895af.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4312676/9859893/c38fa1c8-5af6-11e5-8c72-0af614e895af.png" alt="image" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

A root application of a web site is what will be served when handling a request with no path e.g. "<a href="http://www.mycompany.com/">http://www.mycompany.com/</a>". A web site can also have sub applications. A sub application name is included in the request path e.g. "<a href="http://www.mycompany.com/app1">http://www.mycompany.com/app1</a>". Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition will publish to the root application when the Application name in the publish profile is blank. When an application name is included in the publish profile ("app1" in url above), that name is used as the application name in IIS.</p>

<p><strong><em>Workaround:</em></strong> Republish the sub applications after publishing the root application.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/alphasoftware/AlphaAnywhere/issues/15">View Issue 15 on GitHub</a></p><hr><h2>#16 Custom error pages cannot be a5w pages.</h2>

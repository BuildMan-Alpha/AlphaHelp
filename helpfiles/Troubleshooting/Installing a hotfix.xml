						<case>
							<title nested="2">Stopping the Developer Edition or Standard Application Server</title>
							<description>If you are installing a hotfix for the Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition or the Alpha Anywhere Standard Application Server, stop all running instances of Alpha Anywhere. This includes any instance of Alpha5.exe or A5ApplicationServer.exe. You may need to use *[ui:Windows Task Manager]* to confirm the process has stopped.</description>
						</case>
						<case>
							<title nested="2">Stopping the Application Server for IIS</title>
							<description>
								<p>If you are installing a hotfix for the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS, stop any application pools that are running.</p>
							</description>
						</case>
					</cases>
				</step>
				<step>
					<description>Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the *[ui:[program folder]]*. The *[ui:[program folder]]* is the directory that the Alpha Anywhere executable was installed and is typically found in the following location:</description>
					<list>
						<item>
							<name-title>Alpha Anywhere Product</name-title>
							<description-title>[program folder]</description-title>
						</item>
						<item>
							<name>Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition</name>
							<description>C:\Program Files (x86)\a5V12</description>
						</item>
						<item>
							<name>Alpha Anywhere Standard Application Server</name>
							<description>C:\Program Files (x86)\a5V12 ApplicationServer</description>
						</item>
						<item>
							<name>Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS</name>
							<description>C:\Program Files (x86)\A5V12 Application Server for IIS</description>
						</item>
					</list>
					<note>If you did not install Alpha Anywhere in the default installation directory, the *[ui:[program folder]]* will be the directory on your system that contains the executable for Alpha Anywhere. For the Alpha Anywhere Developer edition, this is the directory that contains the *[alpha5.exe]* executable. For the Alpha Anywhere Standard Application Server, it is the directory containing *[A5ApplicationServer.exe]*. For the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS, it is the directory containing *[A5IISInstallServer.exe]*.</note>
				</step>
				<step>
					<description>Create a new sub-folder under the *[ui:[program folder]]* called *[hotfix]*.  If the hotfix folder already exists, delete any files in the folder.</description>
				</step>
				<step>
					<description>Unzip or copy the hotfix file into the *[hotfix]* folder.</description>
				</step>
				<step>
					<description>Install the hotfix. In Windows Explorer, locate the *[A5Hotfix.exe]* executable file in the *[ui:[program folder]]*. Right-click A5Hotfix.exe to bring up the context menu and select *[ui:Run as administrator]* to install the hotfix.</description>
					<note>Do not double-click A5Hotfix.exe to install a hotfix.</note>
				</step>
				<step>
					<description>Verify the hotfix has been applied. Open the *[ui:[program folder]]* and find the file *[System.aex]*. The timestamp on the file should be the current time after the hotfix is installed.</description>
				</step>
				<step>
					<description>Restart Alpha Anywhere.</description>

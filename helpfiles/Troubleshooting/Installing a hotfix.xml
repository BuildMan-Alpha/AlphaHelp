							<title>Stopping the Developer Edition or Classic Server</title>
							<description>If you are installing a hotfix for the Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition or the Alpha Anywhere Classic Server, stop all running instances of Alpha Anywhere.

							<title>Stopping the Application Server for IIS</title>

						</case>
					</cases>
				</step>
				<step>
					<description>Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the *[ui:[program folder]]*. The *[ui:[program folder]]* is the directory that the Alpha Anywhere executable was installed and is typically found in the following location:</description>
					<list>
						<item>
							<name-title>Alpha Anywhere Product</name-title>
							<description-title>[program folder]</description-title>
						</item>
						<item>
							<name>Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition</name>
							<description>C:\Program Files (x86)\a5V12</description>
						</item>
						<item>
							<name>Alpha Anywhere Classic Server</name>
							<description>C:\Program Files (x86)\a5V12 ApplicationServer</description>
						</item>
						<item>
							<name>Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS</name>
							<description>C:\Program Files (x86)\A5V12 Application Server for IIS</description>
						</item>
					</list>
					<note>If you did not install Alpha Anywhere in the default installation directory, the *[ui:[program folder]]* will be the directory on your system that contains the executable for Alpha Anywhere. For the Alpha Anywhere Developer edition, this is the directory that contains the *[alpha5.exe]* executable. For the Alpha Anywhere Classic Server, it is the directory containing *[A5ApplicationServer.exe]*. For the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS, it is the directory containing *[A5IISInstallServer.exe]*.</note>
				</step>
				<step>
					<description>Create a new sub-folder under the *[ui:[program folder]]* called *[hotfix]*.  If the hotfix folder already exists, delete any files in the folder.</description>
				</step>
				<step>
					<description>Unzip or copy the hotfix file into the *[hotfix]* folder.</description>
				</step>
				<step>
					<description>Install the hotfix. In Windows Explorer, locate the *[A5Hotfix.exe]* executable file in the *[ui:[program folder]]*. Right-click A5Hotfix.exe to bring up the context menu and select *[ui:Run as administrator]* to install the hotfix.</description>
					<note>Do not double-click A5Hotfix.exe to install a hotfix.</note>
				</step>
				<step>
					<description>Verify the hotfix has been applied. Open the *[ui:[program folder]]* and find the file *[System.aex]*. The timestamp on the file should be the current time after the hotfix is installed.</description>

                <p>The AlphaDAO and Storage connection strings that you use when you publish your Web Application are typically different than the connection strings you use while you are building your application.</p>
                <p>For example, your application might use a connection string called '*[xb:Northwind]*'.</p>
                <p>While you are building your application, '*[xb:Northwind]*' might point to a local instance of SQL server, but when you publish your application you will want 'Northwind' to point to your production database.</p>
                <p>This is accomplished by defining how each connection string is resolved in the Web Project Profiles dialog.</p>
                <p>To open this dialog, click the Profiles button at the top left on the toolbar when the Web Control Panel has focus. This will open the Web Project Profiles dialog.</p>
                <p>Select the profile you are using to publish your application.</p>
                <p>To configure AlphaDAO connection strings, click on the smart field for *[ui:Named AlphaDAO connection strings]* to define the connection string to be used for each named connection. The connection string is defined relative to the server where your application will be published.</p>
                <p>To configure Storage connection strings, click on the smart field for *[ui:Named Storage connection strings]* to define the connection string used for each named storage connection. The connection string is defined relative to the server where your application will be published.</p>
                <p>Once you have defined the connection strings, you should be able to publish your application.</p>

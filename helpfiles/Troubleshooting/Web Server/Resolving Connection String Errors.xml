        <p>The AlphaDAO and Storage connection strings that you use when you publish 
        your Web Application are typically different than the connection strings you use 
        while you are building your application.</p>
        <p>For example, your application might use a connection string called 
        '*[xb:connection1]*'.</p>
        <p>While you are building your application, '*[xb:connection1]*' might point to a local instance of SQL server, but when you publish your application you will want 'connection1' to point to your production database.</p>
        <p>This is accomplished by defining how each connection string is 
        resolved in the Web Project Profiles dialog.</p>
        <p>To open this dialog, click the Profiles button at the top left on the toolbar 
        when the Web Control Panel has focus.</p>
        <p>This will open the Web Project Profiles dialog.</p>
        <p>Select the profile you are using to publish your application.</p>
        <p>Click on the smart field for 'Named DAO connection strings' to specify how 
        your the AlphaDAO connection strings (these are the connections for SQL 
        databases) should be resolved</p>
        <p>Click on the smart field for 'Named Storage connection strings' to specify 
        how storage connection strings (if any) should be resolved.</p>
        <p>Once you have done this you should be able to publish your application.</p>

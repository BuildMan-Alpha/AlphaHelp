        <p>Incorrect or missing drivers can manifest as a "cannot connect to database" error from Alpha Anywhere when establishing a connection. To resolve the issue, you must update the drivers for your database system. Specific solutions for some database systems are listed below. Alpha Anywhere ships some database drivers, which can be found in the installation folder. If you do not see your database vendor below, contact your database vendor for driver information.</p>

                <p>Failure to connect to Microsoft Access may be the result of a 32-bit/64-bit compatibility issue with Microsoft Office or Microsoft Office 365. If you have installed a 64-bit version of Microsoft Office, you will need to uninstall that version and install the 32-bit version.</p>
                <p>You can temporarily repair Office by reinstalling the 32-bit engine, however updates will overwrite those changes.</p>
                <p>To correct this issue, install the Access 2010 Database Engine Redistributable. The redistributable can be downloaded and installed from *[extlink:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255]*. Be sure to select the 32-bit version. When installation completes, restart Alpha Anywhere and try to connect to your Microsoft access database.</p>

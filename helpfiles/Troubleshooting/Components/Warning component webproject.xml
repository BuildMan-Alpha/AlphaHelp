        <p>If you open a component in a Web Project (such as 'Default') in the UX Builder then then you subsequently change the Web Control Panel to a different Web Project (e.g. 'Project2'), when you preview the component, you will get a warning saying that the current web project is different than the project in which the component was defined. The reason for displaying the warning is that the component will not run correctly if it loads any resources from the web project folder.</p>

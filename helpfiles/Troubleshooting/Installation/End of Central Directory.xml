    <topic>Last error: End of Central Directory record could not be found</topic>
    <description>
        <p>The Universal Installer caches installation files. When an update is installed, only those files that have changed are downloaded. In rare instances these files may become corrupted. To resolve this, the installer package cache needs to be cleared.</p>

                <p>After the package cache has been cleared, retry the update or install.</p>
                <p>Clearing the package cache does not affect existing installations. It simply deletes cached installer files. These files will be automatically downloaded the next time you install or update a product.</p>

                <p>Requests can fail for reasons outside of the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS. IIS has a component call Failed Request Tracing that can be used to track down why a request is failing.</p>
                <p>The Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS participates in failed request tracing, meaning that it will write messages to the failed request log. If the error occurs on an .a5w page, the details will be in the Xbasic error and/or trace logs.</p>
                <p>The Tracing feature when configuring IIS is required to use Failed Request Tracing. If Tracing is not installed on your system, you will need to add it.</p>

                </step>
                <step>

            <description>A web application published from Alpha Anywhere Developer Edition already has its web.config set to trace HTTP response codes of 400 and above so enabling Failed Request Tracing should be all that needs to done. This setting can be seen by selecting web application and then the Failed Request Tracing item in the IIS group.</description>

            <description>Now, make the request from the browser to load the page. Once youâ€™ve gotten the error go to the failed request logs folder to and double click on the frxxxxx.xml file and to view it.</description>
            <note>If you want to clean up the request logs, only delete the .xml files. *[Do not delete the freb.xsl]*. The freb.xsl file is difficult to recreate.</note>

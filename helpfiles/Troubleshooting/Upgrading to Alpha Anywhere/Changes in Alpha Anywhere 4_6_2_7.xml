    <discussion>
        <p>A new engine for generating PDFs has been integrated into Alpha Anywhere. This PDF engine, called "PDF Direct" or "Direct to PDF" in documentation, will replaces the Amyuni Printer Drivers which have been used in the past to generate PDFs in Alpha Anywhere.</p>
        <p>Starting with this release, PDF generation will default to using the new engine. Developers are encouraged to test their Reports and notify Alpha Software of any discrepancies or issues with Report Generation using the new method.</p>
        <p>Support for generating reports with the Amyuni Printer drivers has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.</p>
        <p>See [Generating Reports with "Direct to PDF"] for more information.</p>

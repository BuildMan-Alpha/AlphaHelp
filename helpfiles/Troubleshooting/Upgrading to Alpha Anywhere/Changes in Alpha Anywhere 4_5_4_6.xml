        <p>A change was made to the *[ui:File Upload]* and *[ui:Image Upload]* actions to disable the Upload button while the file upload is in progress. As a result of this change it may be necessary (in some cases it was not necessary - depends on when the Action was last edited) to edit and save the file and image upload actions in Action Javascript in order to re-generate the JavaScript code for the function.</p>
        <p>This change affects both Grids and UX components that use the *[ui:File Upload]* and *[ui:Image Upload]* action.</p>

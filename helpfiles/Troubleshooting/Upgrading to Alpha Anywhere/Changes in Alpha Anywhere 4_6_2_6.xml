    <topic>Important Changes in Alpha Anywhere 4.6.2.6</topic>
    <description>
        <p>The PhoneGap Build service has been shot down by Adobe. Despite the PhoneGap Build service is no longer available, you can still create mobile apps with Alpha Anywhere using Cordova CLI and Ionic Appflow. Because of this, we have changed instances of "PhoneGap" to "Cordova" in the Alpha Anywhere UI.</p>

        <p>Since Adobe has discontinued the PhoneGap Build service, the PhoneGap menu button has been renamed to Cordova and the PhoneGap Project Settings dialog has been renamed to Cordova Project Settings. When this dialog is opened the App Build Target choices are now CLI and Ionic App Flow. The PhoneGap Build option has been removed. Both the CLI and Ionic AppFlow options are discussed in detail in the Alpha Anywhere documentation.</p>

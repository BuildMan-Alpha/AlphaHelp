                <p>In most cases, you will be better off *[NOT]* doing this upgrade because it can break the build. You can either ignore the notice and close it or click on the upgraded link and select the *[ui:Don't remind me again for this project]* button.</p>

                <p>The Cordova CLI builds the project with the version of Gradle that was installed on the computer from *[extlink:gradle.org@https://gradle.org]*</p>
                <p>If you inadvertently updated the Gradle plugin and broke the build process in Android Studio, you can regenerate the Android project in the *[ui:Cordova App Builder Genie]* and re-open the project in Android Studio. Just be sure *[NOT]* to upgrade the Android Gradle plugin.</p>

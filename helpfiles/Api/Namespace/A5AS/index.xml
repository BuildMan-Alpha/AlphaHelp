		<discussion>The Context object is the interface to the web application server context. It contains the built in Request, Response, Security, and Session objects that are available when handling a web request. This object supersedes other ways to access web application server context (see Server Programming Changes for Version 11) and was made to so that the same object methods and properties will work on the stand-alone server and IIS. Web applications that were built before the Context object was available or using now deprecated functions or objects should be updated to use the Context object so that the web application will transition to running under IIS or any other web server technology available in the future.

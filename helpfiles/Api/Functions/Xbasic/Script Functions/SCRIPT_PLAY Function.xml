The SCRIPT_PLAY() function runs a Global Script. Returns TRUE (.T.) if the script was played. The Script_Name parameter must match the script name exactly and is case-sensitive.
The Script_Name parameter can include an optional library name if you which to specify a script that is in a different database (.ALB file), or is in a dictionary of a table or set that is not attached to the current database.
For example to play a script called "Message1" that is in the "Scripts" database, you would type:

            <description>The execution of the current script is interrupted when SCRIPT_PLAY()  begins, and resumes at the point of interruption after the called script finishes. Any Xbasic statements that occur after SCRIPT_PLAY() are executed.
The SCRIPT_PLAY() command plays the script in the current session. To play a script in a new session, use the SCRIPT_SPAWN()command.
Limitations: Desktop applications only.
 Note : The LOAD_LIBRARY()function does not allow SCRIPT_PLAY() to run scripts. Use ADDIN.RUN()to run scripts loaded with LOAD_LIBRARY(). When creating .AEX files place scripts into functions. Do not call scripts with SCRIPT_PLAY() or SCRIPT_PLAY_LOCAL().

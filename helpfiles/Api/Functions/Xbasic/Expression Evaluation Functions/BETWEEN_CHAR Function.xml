BETWEEN_CHAR() returns a character filter expression based on the two character values and selects records from the table. This function is only useful in Xbasic scripts.  Field_Name is a character field or expression to search on. Low_Value and High_Value are character variables. They are the first and last values in a range of records to find.
Frequently in Xbasic scripts, you need to specify a filter expression in quotes. It can get quite tricky to do this if your Low_Value and High_Value values are stored in variables. For example, the following code fragment shows how to specify a filter expression for an Xbasic query:

dim shared First as C 
 dim shared Last as C

t = tbl.open("customer") 
 query.filter = "between(lastname, " + "\"" + First + "\", " + "\"" + Last + "\")" 
 t.query_create()

            <description>Assuming that First contains "Jones", and Last contains "Smith", query.filter will contain the following value:

            <example><![CDATA[
"between(lastname,\"Jones\",\"Smith\")"

            <description>This is a valid filter expression. However, it is very cumbersome to write the expression that defines the query.filter variable. The BETWEEN_CHAR() utility function makes it easier to write this filter expression. For example:

            <example><![CDATA[
query.filter = between_char("Lastname", First, Last)
]]></example>

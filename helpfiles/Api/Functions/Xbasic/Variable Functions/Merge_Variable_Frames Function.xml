         <description>A dot variable containing one or more sub-variables. If the  otherFrame contains a variable of the same name, the variable value from  the dominantFrame is used.

   <discussion>
Merges the variables in two  different variable frames (i.e. 'dot' variables) into a single variable  frame.

   <example><![CDATA[
'Assume that you have two dot variables (v1, and v2)  defined as follows:
dim v1 as p 
v1.name = "John"
dim v1.cities1 as c 
v1.age = 23
dim v1.arr3 as p 
v1.arr1.item1 = "Row1 - item1"
v1.arr1.item2 = "Row1 - item2"


dim v2 as p 
v2.name = "Harry"
v2.occupation = "Lawyer"
dim v2.cities3 as c 
v2.cities1 = "Boston"
v2.cities2 = "New York"
v2.cities3 = "Chicago"

'Now merge these dot variables, with V2 as the 'dominant' frame
merge_variable_frames(v2,v1)

'Now use the *variable_to_script() function to see what the resulting variable frame looks like:
?variable_to_script(v2)
DIM age as N = 23
DIM arr3 as P
DIM arr1.item1 as C = "Row1 - item1"
DIM arr1.item2 as C = "Row1 - item2"
DIM name as C = "Harry"
DIM occupation as C = "Lawyer"
DIM cities3 as C
cities1 = "Boston"
cities2 = "New York"
cities3 = "Chicago"

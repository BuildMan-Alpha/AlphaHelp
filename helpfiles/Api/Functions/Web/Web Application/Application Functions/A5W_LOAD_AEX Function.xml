	<discussion>Deprecated

This function has been deprecated for Version 10.5, as it is not thread-safe. It will not be available in Version 11 or later. See Change In Way AEX Files are Used in a Web Application V10.5. The A5W_LOAD_AEX() function loads the functions of a compiled library into an A5W web page. The .AEX file can be placed in any directory, as long as the A5W web page can see it. Since the .AEX file does not have to be in the "addins_installed" folder, Alpha Anywhere does not have to be restarted before the functions are registered, and therefore A5W_LOAD_AEX() can be used with shared servers. Limitations, Web applications only.</discussion>

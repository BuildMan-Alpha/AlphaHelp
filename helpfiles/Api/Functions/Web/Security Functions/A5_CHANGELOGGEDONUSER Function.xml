The A5_CHANGELOGGEDONUSER() function displays the Change Logged On User dialog box, allowing you to log onto Alpha Anywhere as a different user.
The function closes all currently open windows. However, this is not like reopening the database, so the autoexec script will not be re-run and the startup form will not be executed. All that happens is the windows are closed and the user is changed.If the developer wants to start over, they should call a5.load(a5.get_name() ).This will completely reopen the database and prompt for a logon again.

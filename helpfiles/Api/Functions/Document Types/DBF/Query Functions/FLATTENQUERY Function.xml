   <discussion>With the FLATTENQUERY() function you can filter the list of records using fields from the one-many child tables. FLATTENQUERY()bhas the effect of flattening the set, and making it appear as a single table. In is generally used in the context of a Browse layout.
In a form or a browse, Alpha Anywhere does not allow you to include fields from a one-to-many child table when you create a query (exception - see the Crosslevel() function). (This restriction does not apply to report, letters and labels). However, if you use the FLATTENQUERY() function, you can include one-to-many child fields in your query.

	<discussion>ALLTEXT_INITIAL() returns a character string of all of the field values in the current record in Table_Alias before any editing changes are made by the user. This function is useful if you want to search for a string in a record, without having to know in which field to search. It is also useful in an index expression when you want to build an index on all of the words in a record to perform Lightning Query Optimized searches in the whole record.
This function is useful if you want to determine if a record was changed.

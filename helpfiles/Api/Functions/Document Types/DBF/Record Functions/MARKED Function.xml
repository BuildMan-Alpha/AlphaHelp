   <discussion>
MARKED() returns .T. (TRUE) if the current record in Table_Name is marked; otherwise it returns .F. (FALSE). If no table is specified, this function applies to the primary table.
Limitations: Because the MARKED() function refers to the currently open table, you should use it only in the context of a open layout.

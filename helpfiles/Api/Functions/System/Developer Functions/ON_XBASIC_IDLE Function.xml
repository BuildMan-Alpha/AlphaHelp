   <discussion>
The ON_XBASIC_IDLE() function register Xbasic code that will be run the next time Alpha Anywhere is idle. (i.e. after any scripts that are running asynchronously have finished). You would typically use this command if you have script that is running into timing problems.
Limitations:Desktop applications only.

            <description>This example calls on_xbasic_idle() twice with the same code, but the code block executes only once (assuming that there was no idle after the first on_xbasic_idle() was called, which there wouldn't have been).</description>

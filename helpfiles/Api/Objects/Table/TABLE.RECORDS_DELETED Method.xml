The <TBL>.RECORDS_DELETED() method returns the number of Deleted_Records in the open table referenced by <TBL>.
When records are deleted from a table they are not physically removed from the table. To physically remove deleted records from a table, you must pack the table using the <TBL>.PACK() method.

   <discussion><![CDATA[
The <TBL>.QUERY_FROM_RANGE() method converts the current range into a query. A query is static, whereas a range is dynamic. You might want to convert a range to a query so as to get a count of the number of records in a range, or to prevent the range of records from changing dynamically. Result_Flag is .T. if the query was successfully created (i.e. a range was in effect), and is .F. if the query was not created (i.e. there was no range in effect)

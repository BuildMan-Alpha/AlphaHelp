   <description>Get the record number order index object for a table.</description>
   <discussion><![CDATA[
The .INDEX_RECORD_GET() method returns an object pointer,  that references the built-in record number order index tag for the table referenced by . Record number order is the physical order in which records are added to the table. For many batch operations in which you fetch records one by one from a table, processing the data in record number order is fastest.
You can use .INDEX_RECORD_GET()in conjunction with <TBL>.INDEX_PRIMARY_PUT() to set the primary index of a table to record number order.

            <description>This script sets the primary index of the current table to record order.</description>

dim tbl as P
tbl = table.current()
indx = tbl.index_record_get()
indx2 = tbl.index_primary_put(indx)

            <description>This script does the same as above, but it is much simpler. Specifying no parameter for .INDEX_PRIMARY_PUT()selects record number order.</description>

dim tbl as P
tbl = table.current()
indx = tbl.index_primary_put()

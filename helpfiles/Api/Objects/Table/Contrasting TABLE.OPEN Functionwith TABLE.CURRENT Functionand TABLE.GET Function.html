<p class=A3Topic>Contrasting TABLE.OPEN() with TABLE.CURRENT()<br><br> and TABLE.GET() 
 </p>



<p><a href="TABLE.OPEN Method.html" title="TABLE.OPEN Method" class="wiki">TABLE.OPEN(</a>) opens a new instance 
 of a table. This new instance has its own record pointer, queries, etc. 
 <a href="TABLE.CURRENT Method.html" title="TABLE.CURRENT Method" class="wiki">TABLE.CURRENT(</a>) and <a href="TABLE.GET Method.html" title="TABLE.GET Method" class="wiki">TABLE.GET(</a>), 
 on the other hand, get a pointer to an already open table. These methods 
 do not open a new instance of that table.</p>



<p>To understand what TABLE.OPEN()does, consider the following scenario: 
 Two users of Alpha Anywhere are viewing the same form. The first user sorts 
 the data by <span class=Code1>lastname</span>. This has no effect on what 
 the second user sees. The second user can sort the data by company, and 
 filter it to see only customers in New York. This in turn has no effect 
 on what the first user sees. Each user has their own view of the data. 
 Of course, if the first user edits a record or adds a new record to the 
 table, these changes are visible to the second user. In effect, TABLE.OPEN()creates 
 another "user" of the table. </p>



<p class=Pix><img src="images/table_open().gif"

							width: 481px;
							height: 313px;
							float: none;
							border-style: none;
							border-style: none;"
					width=481
					height=313
					border=0></p>



<p>On the other hand, to understand what TABLE.CURRENT()or TABLE.GET()do, 
 consider the following scenario: Two people are sitting at the same computer, 
 viewing a form. If one user sorts or filters the data, the other user 
 will see the same selection of records. They are sharing their view of 
 the data. In effect, TABLE.CURRENT()or TABLE.GET()share a view of a table.</p>



<p>So, for example, if a script on a form uses TABLE.CURRENT()to get a 
 pointer to a table, and then it does a query or moves the record pointer, 
 it will impact the form by changing which records are visible in the form, 
 or changing the record that the form's current record. Of course, the 
 script would have to issue the <a href="../Object/OBJECT.RESYNCH Method.html" title="OBJECT.RESYNCH Method" class="wiki">&lt;FORM&gt;.RESYNCH(</a>) 
 command to make sure that the form was synchronized with its underlying 
 table.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if a script on a form uses TABLE.OPEN()to get a pointer 
 to the same table that the form is based on, and the script then does 
 a query or moves the record pointer, it has no effect at all on the records 
 that are visible in the form.</p>

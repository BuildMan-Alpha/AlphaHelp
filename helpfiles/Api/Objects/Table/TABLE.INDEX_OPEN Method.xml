   <discussion><![CDATA[
The .INDEX_OPEN() method opens an existing index file, called Index_Filename, attaching it to an open table referenced by its object pointer, . By default, a table's production index (an index file with the same name as the table file) is automatically opened and attached when the table is opened. In addition to the production index file, you can explicitly attach an index file using the .INDEX_OPEN() method.
If more than one index file is opened for a particular table, all the index files are maintained as records are added or changed.

            <description><![CDATA[This script opens the Customer_temp.cdx index file and attaches it to the current table. The index file is updated to be sure any records that may have been added or changed while the index file was not open are included in the index.

'If you do not have exclusive access, an error is generated.

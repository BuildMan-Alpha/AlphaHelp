   <discussion><![CDATA[
The <TBL>.RECNO() method returns the record number of the current record in the table referenced by &ltTBL>. This is useful if you want to store a "bookmark" for the current record. Once you know a record's record number you can return to that record very quickly by setting the primary index to record number and then using the &ltTBL>.FETCH_FIND() method.

            <description>This script captures the current record number and then after some processing, returns to that record.</description>

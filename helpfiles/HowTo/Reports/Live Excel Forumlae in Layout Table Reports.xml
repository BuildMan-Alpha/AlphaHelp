    <description>When exporting a Layout Table Report to Excel, calculated fields can be configured to export as Excel Formulas, instead of static data.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>Layout Table reports can be created in Alpha Anywhere and exported to Excel. When designing a Layout Table Report, calculated fields can be configured to export their values as Excel formulas rather than static values. This is done by defining settings for a field's Excel property.</p>
        <p>The Excel property allows you to define a Reference and/or Formula for a field in the Layout Table Report. In order to create an Excel formula, both the Reference fields and the Formula must be defined for fields in the Layout Table Report.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose you have a report that displays line items for an order. Each order has a Price, Quantity, and Total. The Price and Quantity are static values while the Total is dynamically calculated by multiplying the Price and Quantity fields together:</p>

                <p>To export the Total field as a live Excel formula, an Excel Reference for both the Price and Quantity fields needs to be created as well as an Excel Formula for the Total.</p>
                <p>For the Price field, an Excel Reference called "excelPrice" can be defined so it can be referenced in a Formula. Similarly, an Excel Reference can be defined for the Quantity field called "excelQuantity".</p>
                <p>Once references are defined for the Price and Quantity fields, an Excel Formula for the Total field can be created:</p>

            <example><![CDATA[{@cell:excelPrice} * {@cell:excelQuantity}]]></example>

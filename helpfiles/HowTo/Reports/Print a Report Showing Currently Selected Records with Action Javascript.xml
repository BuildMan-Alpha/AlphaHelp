	<topic>How To Print a Report Containing the Currently Selected Records</topic>
	<description>With Action Javascript, it is easy to put a button on a Grid that prints a report. You can easily link the report to data in the current Grid row. For example, if the value of the State field in the current grid row is 'MA', you can easily define a filter for the report that shows all states with a value of 'MA'.</description>

		<p>But rather than filter the report based on data in the current row, you might simply want the report to show all of the records that are currently selected in the Grid.</p>
		<p>You can easily do this by using the special currentGridFilter() and currentGridOrder() functions in the filter and order expression of your Grid.</p>

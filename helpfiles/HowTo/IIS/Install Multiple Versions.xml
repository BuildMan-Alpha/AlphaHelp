                    <description>To run multiple versions of the Application Server for IIS, each version must be installed in a separate directory. When installing the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS, you can specify a different directory than the default directory as follows:</description>

                            <tip>When specifying the folder, using the build number (for pre-release builds) or Alpha Anywhere version (for release builds) in the folder name is helpful to distinguish different versions of Alpha Anywhere. You can locate the Build Number or Alpha Anywhere Version on the download page.</tip>

                        <p>If more than one version of Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS is installed, the last one that was installed will set the registry key used by the "Default" location type. To ensure the correct version of Alpha Anywhere is used by a published application, the IIS Publishing Profile must specify the installation location of the version of the Application Server to use on the server.</p>

                    <description>If you have previously published Alpha Anywhere Applications to the server running the Application Server for IIS, you must update the version of Alpha Anywhere to use. When using the "Default" version, the version of the Application Server for IIS that was installed last will be used. In the case where you add a pre-release build or setup an older version of the Application Server for IIS for testing, existing applications on the server will use the new version added to the server.</description>

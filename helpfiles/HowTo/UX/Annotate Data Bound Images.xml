            <p> The ink control allows you to create sketches by 'drawing' with your mouse, any type of pointing device, or with your finger (on a device that supports touch). A common use of the ink control is to annotate images. The image you want to annotate is shown as the background to the ink control and then you can draw 'on top of' the image. When the data are saved the ink is stored separately from the image in a long text field.</p>
            <p> In this video we show how a data bound UX component that allows a user to upload images can be configured to allow the user to annotate the images that are uploaded.</p>

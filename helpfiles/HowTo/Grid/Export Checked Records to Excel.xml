    <topic>How to Export Selected Records to Excel in a Grid Component with a Checkbox Selector</topic>
    <description>Individual rows in a Grid Component can be exported to an Excel file using the Checkbox Selector Column to filter the Grid Component before performing the export.</description>
    <discussion>The [Checkbox Select Column] adds a column of checkboxes to the Grid Component that can be used to select one or more rows in the Grid. The Grid Component can be filtered on the selected rows   using the [{grid.Object}.filterCheckedRows()] method. Once the Grid has been filtered on the checked rows, the "[Export to Excel or Ascii or Custom Format]" Action Javascript action can be used to generate an Excel file that will contain the current records in the Grid Component.</discussion>

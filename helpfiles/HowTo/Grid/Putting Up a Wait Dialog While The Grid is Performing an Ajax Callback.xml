	<description>
		<p>If you Grid does a callback that takes some time (e.g. searching a large database), you might want to put up a custom 'working...' message.</p>
		<p>This example shows how you can do this for a search, but there are client side events that would enable you to put up custom messages for many different types of actions, including sorting, page navigation, saving data, etc.</p>
		<p>Put this in the [canSearchSubmit] event</p>

    <description>The Universal Installer can be run without a UI when an automated installation is needed.</description>

        <p>The Universal Installer can be run in unattended mode with a JSON configuration file containing the options that would normally be set in the Universal Installer UI.</p>
		<p>This can be useful if an automated process is used to deploy a new server or update one or more servers.</p>

            <title>Create a text file for the unattended JSON configuration.</title>
            <description>
				<p>The Universal Installer will use the options in the JSON configuration file in place of the prompts in the UI when running 
				in unattended mode. The content of the file is as follows:</p>
				<p>
					<example caption="Example unattended JSON configuration" code="json"><![CDATA[{
	"mode": "install",
	"productName": "Developer Edition",
	"installationFolder": "c:\\TestDE_8485",
	"buildType": "nightly",
	"version": "8485",
	"shutdownRestartRunningProcesses": false,
	"killProcessesNotRespondingToShutdown": false,
	"retryCountOnFileDownloadError": 5,
	"overwrite": true
}]]></example>
				</p>
				<p>The possible values for each option are:</p>

					</tr>						
					<tr>
						<td>*[overwrite]*</td>

            <title>How to run the Universal Installer in unattended mode.</title>
            <description>
				<p>
				The Universal Installer can be run in unattended mode by using the *[xb:/unattended]* command line switch specifying an unattended configuration file.
				*[xb:/unattended="C:\temp\unattended.json"]*
				</p>
				<p>The Universal Installer will output log messages to the console as well as writing the log messages to the log file. If you do not want log messages written to the console
				use the *[xb:/silent]* command line switch.</p>
				<p>An offline installer package can also be used in unattended mode by including the *[xb:/OfflinePackage]* switch as 
				you would without the *[xb:/unattended]* switch. </p>

				<p>It is best to run the Universal Installer in unattended mode from a batch file in order to handle exit codes for the 
				result of the installer operation.</p>

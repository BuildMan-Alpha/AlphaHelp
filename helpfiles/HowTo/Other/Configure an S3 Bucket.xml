            <description>
                <p>Before you can upload files to Amazon S3, you must configure your Amazon bucket to allow CORS support. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) allows you to make callbacks to a different server than the server from which the page was originally loaded (your Alpha server). To configure your bucket you will need to open the *[extlink:AWS console@https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home]*.</p>
                <p>To configure the CORS policy on an Amazon S3 Bucket, open the *[extlink:Amazon Web Services Management Console@https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home]*, select the bucket, then click the *[ui:Properties]* button. From the Properties screen, open the *[ui:Permissions]* section. Then, click the *[ui:Edit CORS Configuration]* button.</p>
                <p>Below is a sample configuration that can be pasted into the configuration dialog:</p>
            </description>
            <example code="json"><![CDATA[[
   {
       "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
       "AllowedMethods": ["PUT","POST","DELETE"],
       "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
       "ExposeHeaders": ["x-amz-server-side-encryption","x-amz-request-id","x-amz-id-2"],
       "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
   }
]]]></example>

            <title>Accessing PDFs Stored in a Bucket</title>
            <description>
                <p>To view PDFs stored in an S3 Bucket using a control like the [PDF Viewer], your CORS policy needs to allow the 'GET' method. 'GET' allows Alpha Anywhere to read the PDF file from the bucket. For example:</p>
                <p>
                    <example code="json"><![CDATA[[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
        "AllowedMethods": ["PUT","GET"],
        "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
        "ExposeHeaders": ["x-amz-server-side-encryption","x-amz-request-id","x-amz-id-2"],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]]]></example>
                </p>
                <p>See *[extlink:CORS configuration (AWS)@https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ManageCorsUsing.html]* to learn more about CORS configuration.</p>

            <description>
                <p>The S3 buckets used with Alpha Anywhere must have a CORS policy set. The *[ui:Block all public access]* and *[ui:Block public access granted through new access control lists]* must be disabled, as shown in the image below.</p>

                <p>The Bucket policy can be set in the *[extlink:Amazon AWS management console@https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home]* and it will look something like this:</p>

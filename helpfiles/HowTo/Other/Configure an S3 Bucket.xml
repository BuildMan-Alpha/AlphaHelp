            <description>
                <p>Before you can upload files to Amazon S3, you must configure your Amazon bucket to allow CORS support. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) allows you to make callbacks to a different server than the server from which the page was originally loaded (your Alpha server). To configure your bucket you will need to open the *[extlink:AWS console@https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home]*.</p>
                <p>To configure the CORS policy on an Amazon S3 Bucket, open the *[extlink:Amazon Web Services Management Console@https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home]*, select the bucket, then click the *[ui:Properties]* button. From the Properties screen, open the *[ui:Permissions]* section. Then, click the *[ui:Edit CORS Configuration]* button.</p>
                <p>Below is a sample configuration that can be pasted into the configuration dialog:</p>

            <example code="json"><![CDATA[[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "Content-Type",
            "x-amz-acl",
            "origin"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "PUT"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [],
	"MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]]]></example>

                <p>The S3 buckets used with Alpha Anywhere must have a CORS policy set. The *[ui:Block all public access]* and *[ui:Block public access granted through new access control lists]* must be disabled, as shown in the image below.</p>

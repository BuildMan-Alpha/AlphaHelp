                <p>The code below is a script that will fire every 5 seconds. To change to 10 minutes, change the {interval} value to 600 (seconds). The event log is written to a textbox on the xdialog and to a file. See the script 'script1' below.</p>
                <p>Copy the code below to a new script. Save the script as 'autoexec'. 'autoexec' is a special name for scripts in Alpha Anywhere. A script named 'autoexec' will execute immediately when the desktop application is first launched or when the app is opened in Alpha Anywhere.</p>

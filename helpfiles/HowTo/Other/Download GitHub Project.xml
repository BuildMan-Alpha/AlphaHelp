            <description>
                <p>Not all repositories include an Alpha Anywhere project. For repositories without an Alpha Anywhere project, you will need to add the downloaded files to an existing or new Alpha Anywhere web project. This can be done by opening (or creating) an Alpha Anywhere workspace and using the *[ui:Add Files]* button on the Web Projects Control Panel toolbar to add the files to the project.</p>

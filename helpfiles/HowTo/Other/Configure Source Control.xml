    <topic>How To Configure Source Control to Ignore Alpha Anywhere Files</topic>
    <description>Some files and directories in an Alpha Anywhere workspace can be excluded from source control.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>Alpha Anywhere workspaces can be stored in source control systems, such as Git. Not all files in workspace, however, need to be included. Some files and directories should be excluded either because they are user specific or are not needed -- e.g. history files can be excluded because your source control system is performing the role of tracking file history.</p>

                <p>The following is a .gitignore template for an Alpha Anywhere workspace.</p>

            <example><![CDATA[#The following files and directories can be safely excluded from a source
#control repository, such as git. These files are generated and/or are not
#needed because they perform tasks similar to source control (e.g. history files)

#replace <workspace> with the name of your workspace
#replace <project> with the name of the project. E.g. "Default"
#replace <user> with your local user name

#User-specific files found in top level directory

<workspace>.wcp_settings
<workspace>.recent_files
<workspace>.DatabaseExplorer
<workspace>.MUF
<workspace>.WebPublishHistory
<workspace>.<project>.History
<workspace>.<user>.DefWebProject
<workspace>.<user>.RecentWebProject

# Uncomment if using a File Library (A5Lib)
#<workspace>.ALM
#<workspace>.Alx
#<workspace>.MUF
#<workspace>.old_alb
#*<workspace>.old_alm
#<workspace>.old_alx

#Recommended. Files under <workspace>.A5Lib.resources (if A5Lib is used)
*.a5settings

#Folders under top level
.backup*                              #contains backup files
.history                              #contains history files

#The following files and folders are found in  a Web Project folder.
#It is recommended that these files be excluded from source control.

#Files in the web project folder for each project
*.tmp

lastSelectedProfile

#Folders under the web project folder and any subfolders under these folders
__backup.backup                        #contains component backups
__deleted.deleted                      #contains deleted files
__undo.undo                            #contains undo history
__iispublishhistory.iispublishhistory  #contains IIS publish history
__staging.staging                      #staging folder for publishing


#The following files and folders are also found in a Web Project folder.
#These files can be included or excluded from source control at developer discretion

# These are optional (but suggested), and can be included in source control 
# as they are not unique to a user.  While they are regenerated at publish, 
# they should be unique to the component.
*._a5wcmp_manifest
*._a5wcmp_metadata
*._a5wcmp_compiled

#These are usually the same for multiple users, but may be unique.
#Uncomment to exclude from source control

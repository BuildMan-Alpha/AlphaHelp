    <topic>How to Write a Charting Application For a Web Service</topic>
    <description>Charts can be created based on data from a Web Service. Using Xbasic callbacks, data from a web service such as Yahoo! Finance can be retrieved and used to populate a data series in a Chart control.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>When defining the data series for a Chart control in a UX Component, an Xbasic function can be called to populate the data series. The Xbasic function can make an HTTP request to retrieve data from a third-part web service using the [http_get_page2() method]. This data can be used to populate a Chart control with a little bit of work to transform the data into a format the Chart control expects.</p>
        <p>For example, supposed you wanted to display stock information retrieved from Yahoo! Finance to populate a high-low-close chart. In order to populate the chart with stock data from Yahoo!, the data received from the web service needs to be formatted so the Chart control can read the data series:</p>

            <description>With the data in the correct format, the Chart control can render the stock information:</description>

            <title>Yahoo Finance API Discontinued</title>
            <description>
                <p>As of May 2017, the Yahoo Finance API used in this example is no longer available. The *[xb:get_series]* function shown in the videos above has been rewritten to use the Alpha Vantage API. The function below demonstrates how to use the Alpha Vantage API to accomplish the same result as the Yahoo Finance API.</p>
                <p>This example shows how to format the JSON data received from the Alpha Vantage API into the data series format expected by the chart control shown in the videos above.</p>

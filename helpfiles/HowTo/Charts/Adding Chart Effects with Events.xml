    <description>Pie slices can be "exploded" to add emphasis. Chart events can be used to dynamically explode pie slices in a Chart control when the chart is double-clicked. Events also be used to enhance a chart with effects such as popup help or additional details.</description>

            <description>Chart events can be used to add effects, such as popup help or dynamically exploding a slice of a pie chart. To being, you must first enable chart events for the Chart control. This is done by checking the [Has events] property.</description>

            <description>When *[ui:Has events]* is enabled, it exposes the *[ui:Chart Events]* available for the chart control. These events are mouse events that can be utilized to add effects or perform other actions when the user interacts with the Chart control.</description>

            <title>How to Explode a Pie Slice when Chart is Double-Clicked</title>
            <description>In some cases, you may want to add extra emphasis to a portion of data when the user double-clicks on the Chart. For example, suppose you want to explode a pie slice when the user double-clicks on the chart. In this example, we have created a Chart control that uses a Custom data source as defined below:</description>

            <description></description>
            <example code="xb"><![CDATA[function piedata as c (e as p)

dim explodedSliceNumber as n = -1
if eval_valid("e.__javascriptFunctionResults") then
   dim data as p = json_parse(e.__javascriptFunctionResults)
   explodedSliceNumber = convert_type(data.javascriptFunctionResult, "N")
end if

if explodedSliceNumber >= 0 then
explodedSliceNumber = explodedSliceNumber + 1
end if

dim arr[0] as p
i = arr.append()
arr[i].sales = 10
arr[i].region = "East"
arr[i].exploded = 0
           
i = arr.append()
arr[i].sales = 20
arr[i].region = "West"
arr[i].exploded = 0

i = arr.append()
arr[i].sales = 15
arr[i].region = "South"
arr[i].exploded = 0

i = arr.append()
arr[i].sales = 8
arr[i].region = "North"
arr[i].exploded = 0

if explodedSliceNumber > 0 then
arr[explodedSliceNumber].exploded = 1
end if

dim txt as c
txt = arr.dump_properties("sales|region|exploded")

piedata = txt

end function]]></example>

            <description>In the Custom data series that is created, a sub-series that defines the "exploded" state of a pie slice has been included. This allows us to use an expression to define the exploded property of a data point in the Chart as follows:</description>
            <example code="xb"><![CDATA[Series1.exploded = "1"]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>Before the Custom data series is calculated, a JavaScript function is called. The purpose of this function is to pass which pie slice was double-clicked to the Custom Xbasic function that calculates the data series. The value of the selected pie slice is defined in the *[xb:e.__javascriptFunctionResults]* variable in the Xbasic function. The *[xb:e.__javascriptFunctionResults]* holds the return value of the JavaScript function that is called, which is defined below:</description>
            <example code="js"><![CDATA[function pieDataJs() {
    if (typeof {dialog.object}._exploded != 'undefined') {
        return {dialog.object}._exploded;
    } else {
        return -1;
    }
}]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>The variable, *[js:{dialog.object}._exploded]* is a value that is calculated in the Chart control's *[ui:onDblClick]* event. In the *[ui:onDblClick]* event, the *[js:chart.pointNumber]* is retrieved and stored in the variable *[js:{dialog.object}._exploded]*. *[js:chart.pointNumber]* indicates which pie slice in the data series was double-clicked. It is a zero-indexed value:</description>
            <example code="js"><![CDATA[{dialog.object}._exploded = chart.pointNumber;
{dialog.Object}.refreshDataSeries('Series1');
var obj = {dialog.object}.getControl('c1');
obj.refresh();]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>
                <p>After setting the *[js:{dialog.object}._exploded]* variable, the Chart control is refreshed. This triggers a call to the Xbasic function that defines the Chart's data series. When called, the exploded pie slice value is passed in and the data series that was double-clicked is given a value of "1" for it's "exploded" sub-series value.</p>

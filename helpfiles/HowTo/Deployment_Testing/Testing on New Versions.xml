            <title>Install the Application Server</title>
            <important>If more than one version of Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS is installed, the last one that was installed will set the registry key used by the "Default" location type. To ensure the correct version of Alpha Anywhere is used by a published application, the IIS Publishing Profile must specify the installation location of the version of the Application Server to use on the server. See [How to Install Multiple Versions of the Alpha Anywhere Application Server for IIS] for more information.</important>

                    <tip>When specifying the folder, using the build number (for pre-release builds) or Alpha Anywhere version (for release builds) in the folder name is helpful to distinguish different versions of Alpha Anywhere. You can locate the Build Number or Alpha Anywhere Version on the download page.</tip>

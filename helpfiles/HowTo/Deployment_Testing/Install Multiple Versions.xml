        <p>You can install more than one version of Alpha Anywhere side by side on a machine. During the installation process, simply change the installation directory. This will install Alpha Anywhere in a separate location from any existing installations. This is useful when you are migrating an application from an older version of Alpha to the latest release. You can maintain the original app in the version it was built while working out any issues moving forward.</p>
        <p>Installing multiple version is also useful if you want to try out features in the latest pre-release build but don't want to overwrite your existing installation of Alpha Anywhere.</p>

                    <tip>When specifying the folder, using the build number (for pre-release builds) or Alpha Anywhere version (for release builds) in the folder name is helpful to distinguish different versions of Alpha Anywhere. You can locate the Build Number or Alpha Anywhere Version on the download page.</tip>

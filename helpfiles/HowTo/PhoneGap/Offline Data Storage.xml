        <p>The List control is used to build offline applications. Data in a List control is stored in Local Storage, allowing you to access the data when the mobile device is disconnected. Local storage, however, can only store a limited amount of data - typically 5MB. If you need access to large amounts of read-only data, such as a price list or product catalog, Local Storage may not be large enough to hold both the read-only data and the editable records in a List control.</p>
        <p>Instead of using Local Storage, you can leverage the device's file system to store read-only data. In the video below, we explain how to store large amounts of data in PhoneGap applications using the device's file system.</p>

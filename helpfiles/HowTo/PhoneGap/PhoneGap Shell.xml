        <p>In order to test mobile applications that will be deployed using a store - such as Google Play or Apple's App Store - you must publish your Alpha Anywhere application using PhoneGap build. During application development, it can become a tedious process to republish your PhoneGap app using PhoneGap build every time you make a change. You can eliminate the need to republish your app using PhoneGap's build service by creating a PhoneGap Shell application.</p>
        <p>A PhoneGap Shell is created using the UX Component. It includes the ability to dynamically load a UX Component, eliminating the need to republish your entire PhoneGap application with every change. In the video below, we explain how to create your own PhoneGap Shell application.</p>

            <note>When building a PhoneGap Shell, prefer the new *[PhoneGap-Shell-V2]* template. The PhoneGap-Shell-V2 template is an updated version of the PhoneGap-Shell template that includes new features that make it easier to develop and test multiple mobile applications and components using Alpha Anywhere.</note>

    <topic>How to Specify an Alternate Configuration File for the Alpha Anywhere Classic Application Server</topic>
    <description>The Classic Application Server allows for an alternate configuration file to be specified. This is done through the use of a command line option, CONFIGFILE.

                <p>A command line such as this example could be run from a command prompt directly, saved as a shortcut, or used with third-party tools that launch and/or manage programs.</p>
                <p>If the specified configuration file is not found, a warning will be displayed and startup will be aborted. To create a new configuration file, you may either create a new, empty file which the Application Server will then populate with defaults, or you may make a copy of an existing configuration file, start the Application Server, and then modify settings as desired.</p>
            </description>
            <note>CONFIGFILE is only supported by the Alpha Anywhere Classic Application Server (A5ApplicationServer.exe). If specified when starting the Alpha Anywhere Development server (Alpha5.exe), the CONFIGFILE parameter will be ignored.</note>

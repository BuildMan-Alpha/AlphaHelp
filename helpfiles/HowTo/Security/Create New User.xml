    <description>An interface for adding new users to the security system in web applications can be created using the UX Component.</description>

        <p>Managing data in the Web Security Framework at run-time in a web application can be done using UX Components. Alpha Anywhere's server-side action scripting includes actions for creating new users in the Web Security Framework. The videos below explain how this is done.</p>
        <p>In the first video, "Creating an Account for a New User", we show how a UX Component can be used to create a new user account. The UX Component prompts for account information (such as the user name and password), and stores the data in tables used by the Web Security Framework.</p>
        <p>The second video, "Storing Personal Information for a New User in a Related Table", shows how to add additional data about the user to a related table at the same time a new user account is created. The account credentials are stored in the Web Security Framework while additional information for the user account is stored in a separate table, referenced using the user ID.</p>

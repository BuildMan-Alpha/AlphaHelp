    <topic>How to Determine if the User is a Member of a Security Group</topic>
    <description>
        <p>The context.security object has numerous methods for determining if a user is a member of a specific group (a.k.a. "role").</p>
    </description>
    <discussion>
        <p>If the security system has been enabled in an application, the [context.security] object can be used to determine the groups, or "roles", to which a user belongs.</p>
        <p>"Role" and "Group" both refer to Security Groups in Alpha Anywhere. The Alpha Anywhere IDE generally uses the term "Group" while the [context.security] properties and methods use the term "Role". Several methods exist for testing if a user is a member of a specific role (group).</p>
        <p>For example, the Xbasic below checks to see if the user "susan_smith@example.com" is a member of the "Sales" group:</p>
        <p>
            <example code="xb"><![CDATA[dim inSales as L
inSales = context.security.isUserInRole("susan_smith@example.com","Sales")

' Verify the operation succeeded
if (.not. context.security.callResult.Success) then
    ' An error occurred
    error_generate(context.security.callResult.text)
end if

if (inSales) then
    ' User is in the group "Sales"
else
    ' User is not in the group "Sales"
end if]]></example>
        </p>
        <p>This example uses the [context.security.isUserInRole()] method to test if the user is a member of the "Sales" group.</p>
        <p>Other methods available for testing a user's role membership include:</p>
        <p>
            <list>
                <item>
                    <name>[context.security.isCurrentUserInRole()]</name>
                    <description>Test if the currently logged in user is a member of a group</description>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>[context.security.isCurrentUserInRoles()]</name>
                    <description>Test if the currently logged in user is a member of at least one of a set of groups</description>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>[context.security.isUserInRoles()]</name>
                    <description>Test if a user is a member of at least one of a set of groups</description>
                </item>
            </list>
        </p>
        <p>In addition to testing for membership, methods exist for adding a user to a group, removing a user from a group, and listing a user's groups. See [context.security] for more information.</p>

    <important>
        <p>You should *[always]* check the value of *[xb:context.security.callResult]* before using the value from any property or method of the [context.security] object.</p>

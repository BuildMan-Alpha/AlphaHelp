        <p>Markers placed on a map in a Grid component can be animated. Animations are an effective way to draw attention to a new marker or a marker that represents a selected Grid row.</p>
        <p>There are two types of animations for markers: *[Drop]* and *[Bounce]*. The default animation can be set in the Marker properties for a map.</p>

                <p>Animations can also be applied using Action Javascript. The Google Map Methods Action Javascript can be configured to "Bounce a marker". The "Bounce a marker" action will apply the selected *[ui:Bounce type]* to the Marker defined by the Marker index property. The Marker index can be the CurrentRow or a specific row in the Grid component.</p>

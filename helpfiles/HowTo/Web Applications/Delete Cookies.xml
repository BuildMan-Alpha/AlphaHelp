    <description>Cookies can be deleted by specifying their expiration date.</description>
    <discussion>
        <p>You cannot directly delete a cookie on a user's computer. To remove a cookie, you must set the cookie's expiration date and time to a time in the past. The browser will then remove the cookie the next time a request is made and the cookie is inspected.</p>
        <p>
            <example code="xb"><![CDATA[dim cookieName as c
cookieName = "CustomCookie"
if Context.Request.HasCookie(cookieName) then
    dim cookie as P
    cookie = Context.Request.Cookies.Get(cookieName)
    cookie.HttpOnly = .t.
    cookie.Expires = ctodt("1/1/1970 12:00:00 00 am")
    Context.Response.AppendCookie(cookie)
end if]]></example>
        </p>
    </discussion>
    <important>
        <p>The expiration time is the time on the client that the cookie expires.</p>

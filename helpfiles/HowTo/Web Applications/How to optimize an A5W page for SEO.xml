        <p>In general, search engine spiders and crawlers have the capabilities of Lynx: they see HTML, but no images, no JavaScript, and no Flash. Google's can do a little more, but don't count on it for all of them.</p>
        <p>That means that a search engine can only see the first page of a grid, and almost nothing on a Tabbed UI.</p>

                <p>In the grid case, the HTML for the first page is generated before any JavaScript is called. In the Tabbed UI, JavaScript is used to populate the tabs.</p>
                <p>So how can you get search engines to index your content? The best way is to add content within <![CDATA[<noscript>...</noscript>]]> tags on your A5W page.</p>
                <p>For example, suppose you have created a parts catalog. If your Parts.a5w page displays a grid with 10 rows by default, the search engines will only index the links for the first 10 parts. But if you generate an HTML table inside of <![CDATA[<noscript>...</noscript>]]> tags that has links to all of the parts in the database, the search engine will see the links for all the parts.</p>
                <p>Because the Tabbed UI generates its own A5W page, it has a special property for defining the contents of the <![CDATA[<noscript>]]> section.</p>

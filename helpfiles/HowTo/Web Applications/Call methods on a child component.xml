                <title>Getting a Pointer to a Parent or Child Component So You Can Call Methods of the Parent or Child Component</title>
                <description>
                    <p>The ability to re-use components and open a child component in a window, div, TabbedUI pane, Panel, or embed into a parent component is one of the most powerful aspects of the Alpha Anywhere architecture.</p>
                    <p>When you open a component from a parent component, you will often want to get a pointer to the child component so you can manipulate it in your Javascript code in some way. For example, you might want some code in the parent component to read a control in the child, or set a value in the child. Similarly, you might want some code in the child component to read or set a control in its parent.</p>
                    <p>The .getParentObject() and .getChildObject() methods are used to get pointer to an object's parent or child objects.</p>
                    <p>In this video, we show how this is done.</p>

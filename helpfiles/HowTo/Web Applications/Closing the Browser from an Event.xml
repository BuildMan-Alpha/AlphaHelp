	<description>Web publishing applications only. An event script cannot directly close a browser, because its code is executed on the Application Server and does not manipulate the browser. 
 However, you can redirect the browser to page that contains the appropriate JavaScript to close the browser. The code for close.html is illustrated below.</description>

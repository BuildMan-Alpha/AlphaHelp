        <p>The *[ui:Has backround image]* property allows you to add a background image, specified by the *[ui:Image name]* property, to a Panel Card. The background image is usually specified at design time in the UX Builder. You can, however, dynamically change the background image for the Panel Card, adding or changing it at run-time.</p>
        <p>Being able to dynamically define the background image at run-time allows you to change the image when an action occurs, such as when the orientation of the mobile device changes from portrait to landscape. In this situation, you may want to use one image when the device is in portrait mode and another when in landscape mode.</p>

//set the background image to 'image2'
$(id).style.backgroundImage = 'url("image2.png")']]></example>

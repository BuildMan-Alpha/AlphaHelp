        <p>The *[ui:Has backround image]* property allows you to add a background image, specified by the *[ui:Image name]* property, to a Panel Card.

        <p>Being able to dynamically define the background image at run-time allows you to change the image when an action occurs, such as when the orientation of the mobile device changes from portrait to landscape. In this situation, you may want to use one image when the device is in portrait mode and another when in landscape mode.</p>

$(id).style.backgroundImage = 'url("image2.png")']]></example>

    <description>The active Panel can be saved and later restored in UX Components.</description>
    <discussion>UX Components can have complex layouts involving multiple Panel Cards, Panel Navigators, and Panel Layouts. The state of the Panel (i.e., which Panel Card in a particular Panel Navigator is active and which Panels in a Panel Navigator have been docked) can be saved and later restored. This is done using the *[ui:getState()]* and *[ui:setState()]* methods for the top level Panel Object. For example, the code below gets the Panel Object from the UX Component and saves the Panel Object's state in the window when a button is clicked:</discussion>

            <example><![CDATA[var panelObj = {dialog.object}.getPanelObject();
if (panelObj) {
    window._state = panelObj.getState();
    var msg = 'State was saved: \n\n' + $u.o.toJSON(window._state);
    alert(msg);
}]]></example>
        </section>
        <section>
            <description>Another button can be added to the UX Component that restores the state stored in *[js:window._state]* to the top-level Panel Object.</description>
            <example><![CDATA[var panelObj = {dialog.object}.getPanelObject();
panelObj.setState(window._state);]]></example>

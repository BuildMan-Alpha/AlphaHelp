    <topic>How to Export a SQL Query to Excel Using Xbasic</topic>
    <description>Excel files can be generated with data from Xbasic SQL queries in Alpha Anywhere.</description>
    <discussion>SQL queries can be made against a database in Xbasic using a SQL::Connection object to create a SQL::ReultSet. A SQL::ResultSet can be transformed into several different formats - including custom formats using the next() method and assembling the data manually. To transform data into an Excel format, however, you don't need to do it manually. The [toExcel() method] will generate an Excel file that contains the records from the SQL query.</discussion>

            <description>In the example below, a SQL query is made against the Northwind Access database to get all of the Customer records from the Customers table where the Country field is equal to "Spain". The result of the query is then saved in an Excel file called "Customers_Spain.xls". This example was written to be run in an .a5w page:</description>

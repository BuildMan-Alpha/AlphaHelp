        <p>Components can be configured to use the Project style -- the style set in the Project Properties. If the *[ui:Style name]* property for a component is set to &lt;ProjectStyle&gt;, the component will use the style specified in the Web Project Properties' *[ui:Project style]* setting. Some themes that ship with Alpha Anywhere -- Alpha and all styles that inherit from Alpha -- support a compact version of the style or a 'pulse' effect, which adds animation to click events in an application for some types of controls (buttons, list rows, etc.)</p>
        <p>In a component, you can enable the compact or pulse effects by checking a property. However, if you specify that the component uses the &lt;ProjectStyle&gt;, the compact and pulse properties are not available. The compact and pulse properties need to be specified in the Project Properties.</p>
        <p>You can configure the style in the Project Properties to use the compact and/or pulse effect by including special selectors after the style name. For example:</p>
        <p>
            <example><![CDATA[Alpha-Blue:compact
Alpha-Rose:pulse
Alpha-Teal:compact,pulse]]></example>

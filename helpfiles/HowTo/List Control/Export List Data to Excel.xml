        <p>The "List Control Actions" Action Javascript action can be used to export data from a List control to an Excel or Ascii file. When creating the Action, choose the "Export List data to Excel/Ascii" Action name, and specify the List Control that contains the data that will be exported.</p>
        <p>The Export list data settings define the export operation, including the data to export, file format, and actions to perform after the data has been exported.</p>

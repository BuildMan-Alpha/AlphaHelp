        <p>Pull to Refresh is a common feature in mobile applications; it's often used in lieu of a button to update or "refresh" the page. Pull to Refresh can be added to a List Control using the "'Pull-to-refresh' settings" option in the List's properties.</p>
        <p>Pull to Refresh allows the user to update data by pulling down a List beyond a specified threshold, triggering a call to refresh the data in the List. Upon release, the List bounces back to its initial position. The "'Pull-to-refresh' settings" let you define how the refresh icon is displayed as well as the action to take when the event is triggered or cancelled.</p>

        <p>Assume you have defined the following UDF in the code editor.</p>
        <p>
            <example code="xb"><![CDATA[function myFunc as c(arg1 as c, arg2 as c , arg3 as c , arg4 as n )
    myFunc = "test"
end function]]></example>
        </p>
        <p>Now, when you are writing code and you type myFunc( in the code editor, you would like to provide pick-lists or genies for the function arguments. This can be done easily using the addin.function_argument_help() method.</p>
        <p>This method takes these arguments:</p>
        <p>
            <list bullet="true">
                <item>
                    <name>name of the function parameter</name>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>description</name>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name> an Xbasic expression that returns a CRLF delimited list of choices, or that displays a dialog that returns a value.</name>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <name>a code (=, Q, =Q, A, AQ)</name>
                </item>
            </list>
        </p>
        <p>If the code contains 'Q' the function parameter will be quoted when it is inserted into your code.</p>
        <p>If the code contains = the Xbasic expression is expected to display an Xdialog to prompt for a value.</p>
        <p>If the code does not contain =, the expression is expected to return a crlf list of choices</p>
        <p>If the code contains A, the crlf delimited list of choices is in the form 'displayvalue=returnvalue'</p>
        <p>
            <example code="xb"><![CDATA['each of the commands below are a single line - line breaks are for readability only

'when user right clicks on 'arg1' a ui_get_text() dialog is shown.

'choices shown to user are 'First','Last' and 'Closest'. Value entered into function
'when user makes a selection is 'F', 'L' or 'C' (quoted)

'choices shown to user are 'First','Last' and 'Closest'. Value entered into function
'when user makes a selection is 1, 2 or 3 (unquoted)

        </p>
        <p>
            <note>
                <p>The addin.function_argument_help() statements would typically be included in your Autoexec script.</p>
                <p>Once you have executed an addin.function_argument_help() statement, you cannot override it by executing the command a second time. You must exit and restart Alpha Anywhere.</p>

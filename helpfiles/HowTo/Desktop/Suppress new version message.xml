                <p>You can permanently suppress the *[ui:New Version Available]* message by creating a file called *[suppressNewBuildMessage.txt]* and saving it in the installation or workspace directory. After creating this file, the next time Alpha Anywhere launches, the *[ui:New Version Available]* dialog is not shown.</p>

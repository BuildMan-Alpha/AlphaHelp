<p class=A3Topic>Report Overview</p>



<p>Reports are Alpha Anywhere's most versatile type of layout for printing 
 data. Reports can group related records together, perform calculations, 
 order and select the records that appear, divide pages into columns, and 
 conform to just about any format you can imagine.</p>



<p>Reports are created by placing fields, text, and other objects into 
 "edit regions." "Edit regions" refer to areas on the 
 layout in which you alter the appearance of the layout.</p>



<p>The edit regions that appear in a report vary according to your needs. 
 A simple report may consist of the report <span class=Bolded>header edit 
 region</span> to print the title of the report, the <span class=Bolded>detail 
 edit region</span> to list the records in the table or set, and a report 
 <span class=Bolded>footer edit region</span> to display totals or other 
 summary information.</p>



<p>With Reports you can:</p>



<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1><span class=Bolded>Add, 
 remove, and edit the sections of a Report</span> : Reports layouts are 
 divided into sections, which in turn are divided into edit regions. Edit 
 regions are where the objects of a Report are actually placed on the layout.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1><span class=Bolded>Group 
 related records together</span> : You can create your own sections called 
 groups to group related records together. This is helpful if you have 
 data that you want to divide into logical segments. For example, you have 
 a list of sales figures for every day of last year. You can use a group 
 to divide the records into months, and print monthly totals in the Report.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1><span class=Bolded>Order 
 and select the records that appear in the Report</span> : You can order 
 and filter the records that appear in the Report by storing order and 
 selection criteria in the Report, by letting the user decide at print 
 time, or by using a combination of the two.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1><span class=Bolded>Insert 
 calculations to display totals, averages, and other values</span> : Calculations 
 can be performed using data from one record or from multiple records. 
 Summary calculations, such&nbsp;as&nbsp;totals, averages, and standard 
 deviation can be performed using records in individual groups or using 
 every record in the Report.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1><span class=Bolded>Set 
 page-formatting to prevent sections from being split across a page</span> 
 : Alpha Anywhere gives you control over a report's page layout. You can keep 
 sections and edit regions from being split across pages; you can set the 
 minimum number of records to appear on a page, and more.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1><span class=Bolded>Create 
 page headers and footers and continuation headers and footers</span> : 
 Alpha Anywhere allows you to create both page headers/footers and continuation 
 headers/footers. Continuation headers and footers are special sections 
 that appear only if an edit region or section has been split onto a second 
 page. For example, you may create a continuation footer for a customer 
 Report that states "Customers in Massachusetts continued on the next 
 page."</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1><span class=Bolded>Insert 
 page numbers, today's date, and other report-related information</span> 
 : When a report is run, Alpha Anywhere keeps track of certain information 
 such&nbsp;as&nbsp;the current page number. You can also create page numbers 
 for groups that reset when a new group of records begin.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1><span class=Bolded>Use 
 sub-reports to organize data from sets</span> : Alpha Anywhere lets you create 
 sub-reports, which are literally reports within reports. The most common 
 use for this is to print data from sets which contain two or more one-to-many 
 links defined at the same level. For example, you have a set that tracks 
 customer-accounts. The set links a table containing account information 
 to two tables; one table contains a list of charges; the other contains 
 a list of payments. Both are defined using one-to-many links. You can 
 create a sub-report for the charges table and a sub-report for the payments 
 table so that you can display both side-by-side.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1><span class=Bolded>Divide 
 a Report into columns</span> : Columns can be used to divide an entire 
 Report or a single section. This lets you create newspaper-type columns 
 to fit more data on a page.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p class=A3Topic>Suppressing Blank Space&nbsp;on a Report</p>



<p>Alpha Anywhere lets you automatically suppress blank space at the end of 
 each report section.</p>



<p>Normally, if you define a report section of a certain height, the report 
 will print using that size. For example, you may have a single row of 
 data in your report's Detail section. If you define the Detail section 
 to be one inch high, then Alpha Anywhere will print each row of data followed 
 by blank space so that there is one inch between each row of data.</p>



<p>You can choose to have Alpha Anywhere automatically suppress blank space 
 at the end of each report band (i.e. section). To do this, right click 
 in the white space of the report band, choose the <span class=Button>Properties</span> 
 command and then click on the <span class=Button>Region</span> tab. Check 
 the <span class=Control>Shrink contents of band</span> check box.</p>



<p>You can choose to have Alpha Anywhere suppress blank space within a report 
 band by selecting the Allow shrink property for any objects in a section 
 of Report. For example, the following diagram shows the Detail section 
 of a report. The <span class=Code1>Address2</span> field and <span class=Code1>Company</span> 
 field can sometimes be blank, and so their Allow shrink property has been 
 enabled to suppress the space taken up by these fields when they are blank. 
 </p>



<p class=Pix><img src="images/UG_Suppressing_Blank_Space_1.jpg"
					style="width: 318px;
							height: 127px;
							border-style: none;
							border-style: none;"
					width=318
					height=127
					border=0></p>



<p class=Note><span class=Note><img src="images/icon_information.gif"
									x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
									style="border: none;
											width: 36px;
											height: 32px;
											float: none;
											border-style: none;
											border-style: none;"
									width=36
									height=32
									border=0>IMPORTANT</span> : When you 
 set the Allow shrink property of objects that are above and below each 
 other be sure that the objects are not actually touching. Make sure that 
 at a minimum, there is a slight amount of vertical separation between 
 objects.</p>



<p>Another way in which you can suppress blank space within a Report section 
 is to use the Rich Text Object on the report, and place the fields inside 
 the Rich Text Object (RTO). (This is the technique used by the <span class=Screen>Label 
 Genie</span> when you have it create a mailing Label design). For example, 
 the following diagram shows how the address fields in the above diagram 
 could have been laid out in a RTO. The key to using the RTO is to terminate 
 lines with <span class=Button>Shift-Enter</span> (rather than just <span 
 class=Button>Enter</span> ) to create suppressible lines. If a line is 
 terminated with Enter it is not suppressed when it is blank. </p>



<p class=Pix><img src="images/UG_Suppressing_Blank_Space_2.jpg"
					style="width: 266px;
							height: 83px;
							border-style: none;
							border-style: none;"
					width=266
					height=83
					border=0></p>



<p>You can also choose to have Alpha Anywhere automatically suppress blank 
 space at the end of individual objects you place on a report. For example, 
 you may have placed a multi-line memo field object on a Report. You would 
 make the object size big enough to print the maximum memo size. However, 
 for records that contain less text, you would like to shrink the size 
 of the object. To shrink the size of an object, right click on the object, 
 select the Setup tab and check the Allow shrink check box.</p>



<p class=Note><span class=Note><img src="images/icon_information.gif"
									x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
									style="border: none;
											width: 36px;
											height: 32px;
											float: none;
											border-style: none;
											border-style: none;"
									width=36
									height=32
									border=0>TIP</span> : To shrink the 
 size of a multi-line character field, place a rich text object on the 
 form, and place the character field inside the rich text object.</p>



<p class=Note><span class=Note><img src="images/icon_information.gif"
									x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
									style="border: none;
											width: 36px;
											height: 32px;
											float: none;
											border-style: none;
											border-style: none;"
									width=36
									height=32
									border=0>IMPORTANT</span> : If the 
 report band that you want to shrink has multi-line objects in it, be sure 
 to enable shrinking of the individual objects in the report band.</p>

			<p class=A3Topic>Ordering and Selecting Records</p>

<p>You can specify the order and selection criteria for the records that 
 appear in your report either:</p>



<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>in the report layout</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>by interactively performing 
 a query on your data</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>just before the report 
 is printed</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, you have a report that prints a list of customers. If you 
 want the report to always print only customers from New York, sorted by 
 <span class=Code1>Lastname</span>, you can specify those criteria directly 
 in the report layout.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you might have a form that you use to view your customer 
 records. Using the <span class=Screen>Query Genie</span>, or <span class=Screen>Query 
 by Form</span>, for example, you might perform different queries to see 
 different views of your data. After performing a particular query that 
 selects certain records, you might want to print out just those records.</p>



<p>Finally, you might want to decide which customers to print, and in what 
 order, each time the report is printed. You can omit specifying selection 
 and sort criteria in the report, and specify instead that you should be 
 prompted at print time.</p>



<p>The order and selection criteria options can be set in the <a href="../../../Orphans/Detail Properties.html" title="Detail Properties" class="wiki">&lt;span   class=Screen&gt;Detail Properties&lt;/span&gt;</a> dialog box.</p>



<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>While the <span class=Screen>Report 
 Editor</span> is visible, select <span class=Button>Report > Properties 
 > Detail Properties...</span>.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>When the <span class=Screen>Detail 
 Properties</span> dialog box appears, display the <span class=Screen>Records</span> 
 tab.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p class=A5><a name=Setting_Selection_and_Order_Criteria>Setting Selection 
 and Order Criteria</a></p>



<p>Alpha Anywhere lets you store filter and order criteria with the report. 
 Do this by entering expressions in the <span class=Control>Order expression</span> 
 and <span class=Control>Filter expression</span> fields.</p>



<p>If your report contains one or more grouping levels, the primary order 
 of the records is determined by their group break expressions, but the 
 order expression that you enter still applies to the detail records.</p>



<ol start=3>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Optionally, enter 
 an expression that returns a logical value to select records from the 
 underlying table or set in the <span class=Control>Filter expression</span> 
 field. You may click the <img src="ex<x>pression_Button_black.gif"
								x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
								style="border: none;
										width: 22px;
										height: 22px;
										float: none;
										border-style: none;
										border-style: none;"
								width=22
								height=22
								border=0> button to open the <a href="../Alpha Five Basics/Expression Builder.html" title="Expression Builder" class="wiki">&lt;span   class=Screen&gt;Expression Builder&lt;/span&gt;</a> to help you construct the expression. 
 Alpha Anywhere will select the records for which the expression evaluates 
 to TRUE. For more information on filter expressions, refer to <a href="Ordering and Selecting Records.html" title="Ordering and Selecting Records" class="wiki">Ordering   and Selecting Records</a>.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Optionally, click 
 <span class=Button>Marked</span> (records) or <span class=Button>Unmarked</span> 
 (records) to add additional selection criteria. For example, if you select 
 the <span class=Button>Marked</span> radio button, and you enter a filter 
 of <span class=Code1>"State = 'MA'"</span>, then Alpha Five 
 will select only the marked records in MA.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Optionally, enter 
 an expression that returns a character value to order the records you 
 selected from the underlying table or set in the <span class=Control>Order 
 expression</span> field. You may click the <img src="ex<x>pression_Button_black.gif"
												x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
												style="border: none;
														width: 22px;
														height: 22px;
														float: none;
														border-style: none;
														border-style: none;"
												width=22
												height=22
												border=0> button to open 
 the <a href="../Alpha Five Basics/Expression Builder.html" title="Expression Builder" class="wiki">&lt;span class=Screen&gt;Expression   Builder&lt;/span&gt;</a> to help you construct the expression. The order expression 
 generally consists of one or more fields concatenated with the plus sign 
 (+). For example, if you want to sort customer-records by their names, 
 you might use an order expression of <span class=Code1>Lastname+Firstname</span> 
 .</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p class=A5><a name=Additional_Selection_and_Ordering_Criteria>Additional 
 Selection and Ordering Criteria</a></p>



<p>In addition to the selection and ordering criteria that you store with 
 the report, there are some additional options.</p>



<p>The <span class=Control>Additional Record Order and Filter criteria</span> 
 group lets you specify the following options:</p>



<ol start=6>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Optionally, click 
 <span class=Button>None</span>. There are no additional criteria. The 
 report will be based on the filter and order expressions that you have 
 specified.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Optionally, click 
 <span class=Button>Base Report on current selection of records</span>. 
 The report will be based on the current selection of records. This option 
 is typically used when you have a form with a button on the form to print 
 a report. While using the form to view records, you might have run a query 
 to select a particular subset of records. Now, you would like to print 
 out this subset of records using a report. By selecting this option, (and 
 leaving the <span class=Control>Filter expression</span> and <span class=Control>Order 
 expression</span> boxes blank), the report will use the current selection 
 of records.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p class=Note><span class=Note><img src="images/icon_warning.gif"
									x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
									style="border: none;
											width: 37px;
											height: 33px;
											float: none;
											border-style: none;
											border-style: none;"
									width=37
									height=33
									border=0>Note</span> : If you have 
 entered an expression in the <span class=Control>Filter expression</span> 
 field, then the report will be based on the criteria you entered in the 
 <span class=Control>Filter expression</span> field in addition to the 
 filter for the current selection of records.</p>



<ol start=8>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Optionally, click 
 <span class=Button>Prompt for criteria at print time</span> : Alpha Anywhere
 will display a genie at print time, letting you select a primary index, 
 starting and ending key value, and other options. The criteria that you 
 specify at print time are in addition to any criteria that you may have 
 entered in the <span class=Control>Filter expression</span> and <span 
 class=Control>Order expression</span> boxes.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p class=A5><a name=Base_the_Report_on_a_Query>Base the Report on a Query</a></p>



<ol start=9>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Optionally, click 
 <span class=Button>Use filter/order from Query...</span> .</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Select a query from 
 the resulting <span class=Screen>Use a Query</span> dialog and click <span 
 class=Button>OK</span>. This will reset the values of the <span class=Control>Order 
 expression</span> and <span class=Control>Filter expression</span> fields.</p>

</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CListNumber><p class=ListNumber>Click OK to apply 
 the new filter and order criteria to the report.</p>

</li>
</ol>

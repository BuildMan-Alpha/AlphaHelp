<p class=A3Topic>Different Types of Objects in Alpha Five</p>



<p>In Exercise 6, you explored an Alpha Five object of type form. You saw 
 that a form object has certain properties and methods and events that 
 characterize the behavior of a particular <span class=Bolded>instance</span> 
 of a form (like the Sign In form).&nbsp;So when you changed the value 
 of the Sign In form property background color, the appearance of the Sign 
 In object changed.&nbsp;We also saw that Alpha Five forms have events 
 that can be defined with Xbasic scripts.&nbsp;When an event happens, Alpha 
 Five performs the Xbasic commands in that events script.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that Alpha Five includes many different types of objects. 
 All of these objects are components of Alpha Five.&nbsp;Objects include: 
 data tables, forms, browses, controls, the Alpha Five program itself, 
 the <span class=Screen>Code Editor</span>, the <span class=Screen>Control 
 Panel</span>, etc.&nbsp;All of these objects have properties and methods.&nbsp;And 
 some types of objects respond to events if you write an Xbasic script 
 for those events.</p>



<p>Some objects are always present in Alpha Five whether you are using 
 Alpha Five interactively or with a pre-built application.&nbsp;These objects 
 are called <span class=Bolded>system objects.&nbsp;</span> Examples of 
 system objects are <span class=Screen>Control Panel</span>, <span class=Screen>Status 
 Bar</span>, Form, Browse, Set, Table, and the Alpha Five program itself.</p>




<table class="calloutTable" style="x-cell-content-align: top;
				width: 100%;
				border-spacing: 0px;
				border-spacing: 0px;" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<col style="width: 100%;">

<tr style="x-cell-content-align: top;" valign="top">
<td class="TableCell" style="x-cell-content-align: top;
			width: 100%;
			border-top-width: 1px;
			border-top-style: Solid;
			border-right-style: Solid;
			border-right-width: 1px;
			border-bottom-width: 1px;
			border-bottom-style: Solid;
			border-left-style: none;" valign="top" width="100%">
<p class=TableLeft>A system object is an object that is built-in to Alpha 
 Five. You can't create new objects that have the same characteristics&nbsp;as&nbsp;system 
 objects. </p>


<p>But system objects (which allow you to control the behavior of the Alpha 
 Five program) can be referenced and controlled (for example opened and 
 closed through Xbasic scripts.</p>


<p>For example, in exercise 6, the <span class=Screen>Code Editor</span> 
 that you opened to view the Xbasic commands of the <span class=Code1>OnActivate</span> 
 event is a system object. There is only one "instance" of an 
 Alpha Five system object. The <span class=Screen>Code Editor</span> is 
 the instantiation (or instance) of the <span class=Screen>Code Editor</span> 
 system object.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Objects that you create instances of are based on the Table, Set, Operations, 
 or any of the various Layout objects.</p>




<table class="calloutTable" style="x-cell-content-align: top;
				width: 100%;
				border-spacing: 0px;
				border-spacing: 0px;" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<col style="width: 100%;">

<tr style="x-cell-content-align: top;" valign="top">
<td class="TableCell" style="x-cell-content-align: top;
			width: 100%;
			border-top-width: 1px;
			border-top-style: Solid;
			border-right-style: Solid;
			border-right-width: 1px;
			border-bottom-width: 1px;
			border-bottom-style: Solid;
			border-left-style: none;" valign="top" width="100%">
<p class=TableLeft>An <span class=Bolded>instance</span> of an object is 
 an occurrence or implementation of that object type. A Rolls-Royce Cloud 
 is an instance of a car object. The <span class=Screen>Sign In</span> 
 form is an instance of a form layout object.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For example, if you create a new database and define a new table named 
 clients, then Alpha Five creates a table type object named clients that 
 has the same available characteristics (properties and methods)&nbsp;as&nbsp;the 
 system Table object.&nbsp;Likewise, when the Sign In form was created 
 for the Phone Messages database application, that object was based on 
 the system form layout object.</p>



<p>The technical term for creating your own object from an object type 
 is called instantiating that object.&nbsp;The Sign In form layout object 
 is an instantiation of the form layout object type.&nbsp;You can create 
 tables and sets, browses, forms, reports, labels, and letters and operation 
 type objects in Alpha Five.</p>



<p>Alpha Five also instantiates certain system objects itself, but you 
 cannot create additional objects of that type yourself.&nbsp;(For example, 
 you cannot create additional <span class=Screen>Control Panel</span> objects). 
 But you can manipulate the <span class=Screen>Control Panel</span> system 
 object through its properties and methods.</p>




<table class="calloutTable" style="x-cell-content-align: top;
				width: 100%;
				border-spacing: 0px;
				border-spacing: 0px;" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<col style="width: 100%;">

<tr style="x-cell-content-align: top;" valign="top">
<td class="TableCell" style="x-cell-content-align: top;
			width: 100%;
			border-top-width: 1px;
			border-top-style: Solid;
			border-right-style: Solid;
			border-right-width: 1px;
			border-bottom-width: 1px;
			border-bottom-style: Solid;
			border-left-style: none;" valign="top" width="100%">
<p class=TableLeft>A specific object type is also known&nbsp;as&nbsp;a 
 <span class=Bolded>class</span> or category of objects. So a particular 
 form layout object can be spoken about&nbsp;as&nbsp;belonging to the form 
 layout class of objects.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Most of the objects that you will use in Xbasic scripts will be layout 
 and table objects (or simply layouts and tables).&nbsp;In Exercise 6, 
 you used Alpha Five to change the Sign In form object's background color 
 property through the Alpha Five properties window.&nbsp;In order to change 
 an object's property or invoke an object method in an Alpha Five Xbasic 
 script you must know how to reference that object using object addressing.</p>

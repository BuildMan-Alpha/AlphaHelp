<p>You should already be familiar with Alpha Five menus, commands, and 
 database creation and use.&nbsp;For example, to create a new database 
 you could select the <span class=Button>File > New Database</span> 
 <span class=Bolded>&nbsp;</span>command from the Alpha Five Main Menu.

<p>When you display the <span class=Screen>Tables/Sets</span> tab, and 
 then the <span class=Button>New</span> command, Alpha Five presents you 
 with three options.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can create a New Table or a New Set 
 using the respective commands or you can create a table or set by using 
 the Genie.&nbsp;If you choose to create a table directly, Alpha Five will 
 immediately display the <span class=Screen>Table Editor</span> where you 
 can define the name, type, width, and other characteristics of your tables 
 data fields.&nbsp;On the other hand, if you chose the <span class=Button>Create 
 using Genie</span> command (see Figure 2), Alpha Five will ask you what 
 kind of table you want to create and it will automatically define a table 
 structure for you (which you can then modify) in the <span class=Screen>Table 
 Editor</span>. </p>

<p class=TableLeft><span class=Bolded>Code</span> is a name for programming 
 commands. All computers perform tasks according to the instructions that 
 they are told to perform.&nbsp;You create the instructions using a computer 
 language. The language of computer instructions of Alpha Five is called 
 Xbasic. Xbasic is made up of commands (words) that direct the computer 
 to perform certain actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain rules (syntax) 
 you must follow when you specify the Xbasic commands you want the computer 
 to process.&nbsp;When you create a file or set of Xbasic commands we call 
 that file an Alpha Five <span class=Bolded>script</span>. The name script 
 is related to a movie script.&nbsp;Just&nbsp;as&nbsp;a movie script tells 
 the actors what to say and do, an Alpha Five script contains Xbasic commands 
 that tell the computer what you want it to do.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Once a table is defined, you can use the other choices on the Alpha 
 Five <span class=Screen>Control Panel</span> (see Figure 3).&nbsp;You 
 can create Forms and Browses to use for viewing, entering, and modifying 
 your data.&nbsp;You can design Reports, Letters, or Labels to use in reviewing, 
 displaying, and printing your data.&nbsp;And you can define an Operation 
 to manipulate, transfer, search, and summarize your data.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Finally, you can create <span class=Bolded>Code</span> or programming 
 commands.&nbsp;&nbsp;The code you create is stored in text files that 
 are called <span class=Bolded>scripts</span>.&nbsp;A script (which contains 
 a sequence of Xbasic commands) can be re-used or run.&nbsp;When Alpha 
 Five runs a script, it performs all the Xbasic commands that are in the 
 script.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A script is a text file containing valid (syntactically correct) Xbasic 
 commands that Alpha Five processes and executes. When you create a new 
 script in the <span class=Screen>Control Panel</span>, <span class=Screen>Code</span> 
 section, you will give the script a name (i.e., the text file that contains 
 the Xbasic commands is named just like any other file on your computer). 
 Alpha Five scripts are stored and associated with the currently active 
 database. However, Alpha Five contains a special area called the <span 
 class=Bolded>Code Library</span> that lets you easily share script files 
 among different databases. </p>

<p class=PixCaption>Figure 4. The Code tab shows other types of files besides 
 scripts. functions (a special type of script) are listed here as well 
 as Custom menus, toolbars, and graphic image files.</p>



<p>For example, if you open the <span class=Screen>Control Panel Code</span> 
 tab panel for the "Phone Messages" (or "Learning Xbasic") sample database application, you will 
 see the names of all the scripts created for use in the application. The 
 first script is named <span class=Code1>Chng Msgs Dsply Order</span> (which 
 stands for Change Messages Display Order) as shown in Figure 4 above. 
 When you ask Alpha Five to perform the commands in a script, you specify 
 the script name.</p>



<p>Some scripts are already named in Alpha Five. There are special scripts 
 in Alpha Five called events. <span class=Bolded>Events</span> are files 
 containing Xbasic commands (you will learn more about events a little 
 later), just like scripts, but they are already named and associated with 
 specific Alpha Five components.</p>

<p class=TableLeft><span class=Bolded>Events</span> are pre-named Alpha 
 Five scripts. You define what Xbasic commands are executed when an event 
 is triggered, but events are already built-in (named) in Alpha Five.&nbsp;Events 
 are part of Alpha Five components.&nbsp;For example, a button control 
 on a form has events.&nbsp;One button control event is named <span class=Code1>OnPush</span> 
 (which is named for the event that occurs when you push that button). 
 When you first create a control there are no Xbasic commands defined for 
 the <span class=Code1>OnPush</span> event.&nbsp;You add those commands 
 to control what happens when that button is pushed.</td></tr>

					width=256

					border=0> </p>



<p>As you have learned, a script is a sequence or listing of Xbasic commands. 
 Xbasic commands perform Alpha Five tasks. For example, here is an Xbasic 
 command:</p>




<table class="codeTable" style="x-cell-content-align: top;
				border-left-style: None;
				border-right-style: None;
				border-top-style: None;
				border-bottom-style: None;
				width: 100%;
				border-spacing: 0px;
				border-spacing: 0px;" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<col style="width: 100%;">

<tr style="x-cell-content-align: top;" valign="top">
<td style="x-cell-content-align: top;
			width: 100%;
			padding-right: 10px;
			padding-left: 10px;" valign="top" width="100%">
<p class=Code>Form.View(Administration)&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If Alpha Five encounters this command in a script, it performs the action 
 this command specifies. The first word in this command is Form which tells 
 Alpha Five you want to do something with a form. Next comes a period and 
 then the word View. View signifies that you want a form to be displayed 
 or viewed on the screen. Finally, in the parentheses, you specify the 
 name of the form that you want displayed. (This name must be enclosed 
 in parentheses.) So, assuming that a form named Administration exists 
 in the current database, Alpha Five will display that form on the screen. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;If 
 there are more commands in the script, Alpha Five will continue with the 
 next command.</p>



<p>For example, after loading the form Administration you might want to 
 display the last record in the table. This Xbasic command will do that:</p>




<table class="codeTable" style="x-cell-content-align: top;
				border-left-style: None;
				border-right-style: None;
				border-top-style: None;
				border-bottom-style: None;
				width: 100%;
				border-spacing: 0px;
				border-spacing: 0px;" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<col style="width: 100%;">

<tr style="x-cell-content-align: top;" valign="top">
<td style="x-cell-content-align: top;
			width: 100%;
			padding-right: 10px;
			padding-left: 10px;" valign="top" width="100%">
<p class=Code>Administration.Fetch_Last()</td></tr>
</table>

<p>We can use these two commands together in a complete two line Xbasic 
 script.</p>




<table class="codeTable" style="x-cell-content-align: top;
				border-left-style: None;
				border-right-style: None;
				border-top-style: None;
				border-bottom-style: None;
				width: 100%;
				border-spacing: 0px;
				border-spacing: 0px;" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<col style="width: 100%;">

<tr style="x-cell-content-align: top;" valign="top">
<td style="x-cell-content-align: top;
			width: 100%;
			padding-right: 10px;
			padding-left: 10px;" valign="top" width="100%">
<p class=Code>Form.View(Administration)</p>


<p class=Code>Administration.Fetch_Last()</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If they are saved in a script named <span class=Code1>Load Last Person</span>, 
 then whenever we want to display the last person using the Administration 
 form, you can run the script <span class=Code1>Load Last Person</span>.</p>



<p class=Pix><img src="images/LB_edit_contacts_fetch_last.gif"
					x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
					style="border: none;
							width: 300px;
							height: 252px;
							float: none;
							border-style: none;
							border-style: none;"
					width=300
					height=252
					border=0> </p>



<p>You can do the very same things done by the <span class=Code1>Load Last 
 Person</span> script in Exercise 1 using Alpha Fives menus and buttons. 
 Its a simple matter to load the Administration form using the <span class=Button>View</span> 
 button on the <span class=Screen>Control Panel</span> and then pressing 
 the <span class=Button>Last</span> button to load the last record as shown 
 in Figure 10.</p>



<p>But heres the interesting part! When you click on the buttons like the 
 <span class=Button>Last</span> button, Alpha Five is actually performing 
 the same Xbasic commands that are in the <span class=Code1>Load Last Person</span> 
 script you examined above. When you press the Last button Alpha Five performs 
 the Xbasic command <span class=Code1><a class="wiki"  href="CURRENT_FORM_NAME" rel="">CURRENT_FORM_NAME</a>.Fetch_Last()</span> 
 (where the actual name or reference to the current form is substituted 
 in the Xbasic command for <span class=Code1><a class="wiki"  href="CURRENT_FORM_NAME" rel="">CURRENT_FORM_NAME</a></span> 
 ).</p>



<p>In fact, Xbasic is such a powerful language, that most of the Alpha 
 Five menu commands, buttons, and screens are Xbasic commands and scripts 
 themselves. This means that the more Xbasic commands you learn, the more 
 you can customize your applications to look, perform, and execute commands 
 just the way you want them to.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that Alpha Five is running Xbasic behind the scenes when 
 you use the built-in Alpha Five menus and commands. And, as you will see 
 later on, Alpha Five can actually write Xbasic code for you! <span class=Bolded>Action 
 scripting</span> consists of Alpha Five Genies that ask you what you want 
 to accomplish and then create scripts automatically. You can modify the 
 code to tweak it in just the way you want, but you save the time and effort 
 of starting from scratch.</p>



<p>In Figure 11 you can see the choices available to you when you create 
 a new script. In this case, we clicked on the <span class=Screen>Code</span> 
 Tab in the <span class=Screen>Control Panel</span> and then clicked the 
 <span class=Button>New</span> button.</p>



<p>When you select the <span class=Button>New Database</span> <span class=Bolded>&nbsp;</span>command, 
 Alpha Five prompts you for a database name and then brings you to the 
 <span class=Screen>Control Panel</span> where you can begin to design 
 any of the components for your new database system. Typically, you begin 
 by designing the tables that store the data pertinent to your new database.</p>

<p>The active (foreground) tab shows the script you are currently editing. 
 The name of the script appears in the tab.&nbsp;An asterisk after the 
 name indicates the script has been changed but those changes haven't been 
 saved.&nbsp;When you create a new script, the name will be Untitled_#

 save it by selecting the <span class=Button>Save</span> or <span class=Button>Save&nbsp;as</span>&nbsp;commands.</p>


<p>The other tab in Figure 8 is labeled <span class=Bolded>Interactive</span>. 
 This is a special window where you can type and execute Xbasic commands 
 interactively or at once line by line.&nbsp;Using the <span class=Screen>Interactive

<p>The Alpha Five Window Bar shows three running windows. Clicking the 
 buttons allows you to quickly switch windows.</p>



<p>Running a script means that Alpha Five runs or executes each of the 
 commands in the script line by line. Some commands will loop back and 
 execute certain lines a number of times before proceeding; Other commands 
 might extend over many lines of typed text but are treated when entered 
 correctly as one command.</p>



<p>When you click on <span class=Button>Run</span> the Administration form 
 loads and the last record is fetched as shown below in Figure 9. The primary 
 index for this table is by last name, so the Fetch command loads the last 
 record by that index.</p>

<p class=A3Topic>End Note</p>



<p>Hopefully, you have gotten a feel for the power and flexibility of the 
 Xbasic commands and components.&nbsp;You have learned about all the major 
 programming methods and tools that Alpha Anywhere provides with the Xbasic 
 language.</p>



<p>You have seen how you can use Action Scripting to have scripts written 
 for you.&nbsp;Using Action Scripting and then studying the code is an 
 excellent way to get up to speed with Xbasic.&nbsp;You can learn more 
 techniques by running the Its For You application, understanding what 
 it does, and then exploring the scripts that are part of the application 
 in the <span class=Screen>Code Editor</span>.</p>



<p>Read the Introduction to Action Scripting and <a href="../../Orphans/Learning Xdialog Title.html" title="Learning Xdialog Title" class="wiki">Learning   Xdialog</a> books that accompany this book to go in-depth with both of 
 these areas.</p>



<p>You will soon be writing your own Xbasic global scripts, events and 
 functions that will enable you to create database applications faster 
 and easier than ever.&nbsp;Watch for new and more features in Xbasic and 
 Alpha Anywhere coming soon.</p>



<p>And, finally, thanks for using Xbasic and Alpha Anywhere and Above: 
 The Revolutionary Way To Build Sophisticated Database Applications!</p>

<p class=A3Topic>AlphaSports for the Web</p>



<p class=A5>Initial considerations</p>



<p>Creating an application for a Web environment is an interesting challenge. 
 Web applications require a different approach and different thinking than 
 desktop applications. You can easily build a desktop application that 
 has complex form designs, large amounts of data on one page, and multiple 
 pages open simultaneously. Speed is rarely an issue with modern computers, 
 and the current design genies allow considerable customization of any 
 layout.</p>



<p>But the Web is different. The browser concept imposes a number of constraints. 
 Browsers primarily use HTML and other "open source" concepts 
 like JavaScript. Nearly every modern browser follows a set of universal 
 standards to allow a Web page to display in any browser. These rules place 
 many limitations on how various elements work, such&nbsp;as&nbsp;how a 
 drop down list looks and behaves, how data is submitted back to a server, 
 how buttons operate, and on and on. The layout of most Web pages is normally 
 based on a grid or table and cell construction that requires some careful 
 planning during design. Moving the position of an element on a page may 
 require reconstructing the complete page. There is little room to alter 
 the way the way the actual design elements work because they are part 
 of the accepted rules for a browser. Any successful Web page must follow 
 these current Web standards to work properly.</p>



<p>The other issue is speed. The Web employs a Client/Server model. The 
 local browser or client first requests a page from a remote server. The 
 server takes the request and builds the page and populates it with data. 
 It then sends the whole page back to the client. Both of these actions 
 require time. If the page design is complex, the server may take a noticeable 
 time to build or populate the page. If the final page file size is large, 
 the download time across the Web may be slow. These issues exist in any 
 Web page construction, regardless of the server technology used. A successful 
 Web designer must consider these limitations and frequently make compromises 
 on the complexity of the page designs.</p>



<p class=A5>Specifications</p>



<p>The basic goal behind the design of <span class=Screen>AlphaSports Web</span> 
 was a desire to create a "real world" commercial grade application 
 that was based on the existing AlphaSports desktop demo application. The 
 design had to consider the normal constraints of the Web environment and 
 yet be a successful substitute for a desktop application. A common use 
 of the Alpha Anywhere <span class=Screen>Application Server</span> is to add 
 Web capability to an existing desktop application. AlphaSports Web does 
 not alter the AlphaSports desktop functionality and can co-exist with 
 that application. However, the two applications are completely separate 
 and only share tables and data. The Web application does not require a 
 desktop database to operate, and can actually exist without any related 
 database. It replaces the desktop database functionality with the Web 
 components and pages and accesses tables and data directly.</p>



<p>Every application design starts with the functional requirements or 
 specifications. This application was built around an online shopping concept, 
 with the capability to update and maintain the supporting data using a 
 browser interface. Early in the process, it was determined that the final 
 design should appear simple to use with relatively few "layers" 
 to the data. The decision was made to access most pages from a main navigation 
 page or menu bar. To simplify navigation, a number of pages open&nbsp;as&nbsp;pop-ups, 
 leaving the original page in view. Many pages have multiple ways to navigate 
 to other pages, such&nbsp;as&nbsp;links in grids, hyperlinks on the pages, 
 buttons, and even images with links.</p>



<p>Nearly all of the functionality of the desktop AlphaSports database 
 was duplicated in the Web version. This was achieved by creating two different 
 paths within the application. First, there are the public pages that are 
 designed for online sales and promoting the products available from AlphaSports. 
 Most of these pages do not require any login or security. The second path 
 within the application is the administration section. These pages can 
 only be accessed with a specific login and have security to prevent unauthorized 
 access. Many of these pages duplicate the data maintenance actions normally 
 found in a desktop implementation. The login process determines the navigation 
 path by evaluating the user ID and then sending the user to the pages 
 allowed by their access.</p>



<p>A secondary purpose was to show how to use various Alpha Anywhere components 
 effectively and efficiently. Nearly every page is built using components, 
 many with multiple components. In fact, every basic component construction 
 is found in AlphaSports for the Web.</p>



<p class=A5>Building AlphaSports Web</p>



<p>To improve speed the AlphaSports Web application keeps the number of 
 elements on each page to a minimum. Many of pages are view-only pages 
 with links to pages that do allow editing. A page with only labels is 
 both faster to build on the server and has less HTML text. Therefore it 
 will build and download faster. Only pages that are used less frequently, 
 such&nbsp;as&nbsp;some internal maintenance pages, make extensive use 
 of input fields. Every effort was made to eliminate unnecessary HTML in 
 AlphaSports Web. For example, instead of adding inline styles to set a 
 cell width in a grid, most column widths were fixed by setting the column 
 header width. The inline style adds some text, but it only is added for 
 the column row instead of for each cell in each row. Even apparently small 
 changes like this can have measurable impacts on speed.</p>



<p>A common error with grid layouts is to try to use too many rows. While 
 showing many rows on a page may appear to be a good idea, this design 
 approach slows page building and downloading. At some point, the speed 
 impact negates the apparent efficiency of having everything on one page. 
 A decision was made in AlphaSports Web to break up the data into small 
 pieces&nbsp;as&nbsp;much&nbsp;as&nbsp;possible, use limited rows in grids, 
 and use multiple pages. Not only are the pages faster to build, but the 
 download times are improved, making the pages display quicker. Even removing 
 a single field in a grid can have a significant speed impact.</p>



<p>Freeform regions are used in many of the components in AlphaSports. 
 These allow more design freedom and have no real speed impact. A few grids 
 use custom controls that provide some unique opportunities for customizing 
 a display. In AlphaSports Web they are used to highlight products with 
 "special" pricing. Considerable effort was spent on attention 
 to detail to add an appearance of professionalism, such&nbsp;as&nbsp;making 
 input text boxes a uniform length.</p>



<p>Many Web pages require some method to select a value from a list to 
 populate some input value. A typical construction is a drop down list. 
 However, a grid layout may require multiple drop down lists with one built 
 for each record in a row. A more efficient method is to take advantage 
 of the lookup option in Alpha Anywhere. AlphaSports Web makes extensive use 
 of lookups. Drop downs are used in some places where the options are limited, 
 or in the case of dialogs or single record grids where the drop down appears 
 only once.</p>



<p>Another goal of this project was to build modular constructions. A page 
 template was built for the public pages and another built for the internal 
 or administrative pages. After the templates were refined, building other 
 pages became very efficient&nbsp;as&nbsp;the page building process consisted 
 of adding a single component to the template page.</p>



<p>As the project began to take shape, it was observed that there was an 
 opportunity to use the same basic component design in multiple locations. 
 One example is the single record tabbed grid used to show customer information. 
 This was used on multiple pages by first building the component with all 
 features needed. After placing a component on a given page, parameter 
 overrides changed the style of the component or hide or alter certain 
 features such&nbsp;as&nbsp;a delete option. In this way, a single component 
 was built just once, but used many times.</p>



<p>Efficiency was the primary goal of the AlphaSports Web construction. 
 Efficiency in usability through relatively simple page layouts, efficiency 
 in construction through the modular approach, and efficiency in speed 
 through minimizing the html on a page.</p>



<p>Working within the constraints of the Web is challenging, but the component 
 concept in Alpha Anywhere removes many of the concerns. The final component 
 output meets the "rules of the road", without the user having 
 to write any HTML or worry about the standards. The Component Builders 
 are very efficient tools that can make building a Web application easier 
 and faster without compromising the final result.</p>

WINHELP_SHOW() displays a topic in a standard Windows help (.hlp) file.  Help_Filename is the fully qualified help file name. Help_Topic is the name of the topic (index entry) in the help file to display.
 Note : In addition to displaying help topics from a standard Windows help file, certain versions of Alpha Anywhere also include a built-in help system and you can also display topics from this help system. See HELP_FILE_VIEW().
Limitations: Desktop applications only.

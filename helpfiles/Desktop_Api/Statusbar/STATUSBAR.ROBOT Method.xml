The STATUSBAR.ROBOT() method displays a broken line bar graph on the Status Bar indicating that a task is being performed. The broken line grows until it reaches the end of its display area on the Status Bar, and then it restarts. Use this method when you do not know the total number of iterations in a task. If you do know how many iterations a task has, use the STATUSBAR.PERCENT() method instead.

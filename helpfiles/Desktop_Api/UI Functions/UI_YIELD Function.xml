Use UI_YIELD() in fast running loops to provide Alpha Anywhere with time to refresh the screen display.
 Note : XBASIC_WAIT_FOR_IDLE()  waits for the main loop to idle. The main loop is the entire Alpha Anywhere application. For example, if there are any messages that need to be processed (such as a screen repaint), the Xbasic script will wait until those messages have been processed. So for example, this will allow a screen repaint, a focus change, initializing of menus and toolbars on a  form open, etc. to happen before your Xbasic script continues. UI_YIELD() is similar to XBASIC_WAIT_FOR_IDLE() , but just allows pending screen repaints to happen. It does not allow other messages (such as form activate, deactivate, change of focus etc) in the message queue to happen.

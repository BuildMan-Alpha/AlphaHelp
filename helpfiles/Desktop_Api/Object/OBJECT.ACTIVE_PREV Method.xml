   <description>This script (which is attached to a button on a form) returns focus to the object that had focus immediately prior to clicking the button (so that the button code can operate on that object). In this example, the button blanks out the value in the field that had focus by setting its text property to a NULL value.</description>
   <example><![CDATA[
prev_obj = parentform.Active_prev()
obj_point = obj(prev_obj)
obj_point.activate()
obj_point.text = "" ]]></example>

ServerSideQueryRetract() Method - Removes the previously applied server-side incremental filter to the primary table of a browse or form layout (assuming that the primary table is an active-link table).  The server-side query is applied using the <Layout>.ServerSideQueryRun() method. This method has an additive  parameter. If the .ServerSideQueryRun() method is called with additive  set to .t. then the queries are added to a stack. The .ServerSideQueryRetract() method removes the last query from the stack. To remove all queries from the stack, see the .ServerSideQuery_Show_All() method.
